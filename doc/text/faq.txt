2.3.3. I would like to help you, what do I do?

   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new
   developers, RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account
   on sourceforge.net and mail your id to the developer mailing list.
   Once we have added you to the team, you'll have write access to the
   CVS repository, and we'll find a suitable task for you together.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.4. Do you still maintain the blocklists?

   No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the
   versions 2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will
   again be blocklists that you can update automatically.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.5. How can I submit new ads?

   As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
   have released the new version, there will again be a form on the
   website, which you can use to contribute new ads.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.6. How can I hide my IP address?

   You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3.7. What is the imagefile (simage.ini, etc.) for?

   Anytime the Junkbuster determines (with the help of the blocklist)
   that a URL contains an advertisement, it has to decide whether this
   advertisement is an image or not. The Junkbuster uses the imagefile
   for that purpose.
