CLASS="APPLICATION"

></H1
><P
> Before launching <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> for the first time, you 
 will want to configure your browser(s) to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy. The default is localhost for the proxy address,
 and port 8118 (earlier versions used port 8000). This is the one
 configuration step that must be done! </P
><P
> 
 With <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Netscape</SPAN
> (and
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mozilla</SPAN
>), this can be set under <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Edit
 -&#62; Preferences -&#62; Advanced -&#62; Proxies -&#62; HTTP Proxy</TT
>.
 For <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Internet Explorer</SPAN
>: <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Tools -&#62;
 Internet Properties -&#62; Connections -&#62; LAN Setting</TT
>. Then,
 check <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Use Proxy"</SPAN
> and fill in the appropriate info (Address:
 localhost, Port: 8118). Include if HTTPS proxy support too.</P
><P
> After doing this, flush your browser's disk and memory caches to force a
 re-reading of all pages and to get rid of any ads that may be cached. You 
 are now ready to start enjoying the benefits of using
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>!</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is typically started by specifying the
 main configuration file to be used on the command line. Example Unix startup
 command:</P
><P
> <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
> 
 # /usr/sbin/privoxy /etc/privoxy/config</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
> See <A
HREF="startup.html#CMDOPTIONS"
>below</A
> for other command line options.</P
><P
> An init script is provided for SuSE and Red Hat.</P
><P
> For for SuSE: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rcprivoxy start</B
></P
><P
> For Red Hat and Debian: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>/etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start</B
></P
><P
> If no configuration file is specified on the command line,
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will look for a file named
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config</TT
> in the current directory. Except on Win32 where
 it will try <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config.txt</TT
>. If no file is specified on the
 command line and no default configuration file can be found, 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will fail to start.</P
><P
> The included default configuration files should give a reasonable starting
 point. Most of the per site configuration is done in the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
> files. These are where various cookie actions are
 defined, ad and banner blocking, and other aspects of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> configuration. There are several such
 files included, with varying levels of aggressiveness. </P
><P
> You will probably want to keep an eye out for sites for which you may prefer
 persistent cookies, and add these to your actions configuration as needed. By
 default, most of these will be accepted only during the current browser
 session (aka <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"session cookies"</SPAN
>), unless you add them to the
 configuration. If you want the browser to handle this instead, you will need
 to edit <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT
> (or through the web based interface)
 and disable this feature. If you use more than one browser, it would make
 more sense to let <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> handle this. In which
 case, the browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.</P
><P
> Another feature where you will probably want to define exceptions for trusted
 sites is the popup-killing (through the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>+popup</TT
> and
 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>+filter{popups}</TT
> actions), because your favorite shopping,
 banking, or leisure site may need popups (explained below). </P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is HTTP/1.1 compliant,  but not all of
 the optional 1.1 features are as yet supported. In the unlikely event that
 you experience inexplicable problems with browsers that use HTTP/1.1 per default
 (like <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mozilla</SPAN
> or recent versions of I.E.), you might
 try to force HTTP/1.0 compatibility. For Mozilla, look under <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Edit -&#62;
 Preferences -&#62; Debug -&#62; Networking</TT
>.
 Alternatively, set the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+downgrade-http-version"</SPAN
> config option in
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>default.action</TT
> which will downgrade your browser's HTTP
 requests from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 before processing them.</P
><P
> After running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> for a while, you can 
 start to fine tune the configuration to suit your personal, or site, 
 preferences and requirements. There are many, many aspects that can 
 be customized. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Actions"</SPAN
> 
 can be adjusted by pointing your browser to 
 <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/</A
>
 (shortcut: <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
>), 
 and then follow the link to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"View &#38; Change the Current Configuration"</SPAN
>. 
 (This is an internal page and does not require Internet access.)</P
><P
> In fact, various aspects of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 configuration can be viewed from this page, including 
 current configuration parameters, source code version numbers, 
 the browser's request headers, and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
> that apply 
 to a given URL. In addition to the actions file 
 editor mentioned above, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can also 
 be turned <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"on"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"off"</SPAN
> (toggled) from this page.</P
><P
> If you encounter problems, try loading the page without
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. If that helps, enter the URL where
 you have the problems into <A
HREF="http://p.p/show-url-info"
TARGET="_top"
>the browser
 based rule tracing utility</A
>. See which rules apply and why, and
 then try turning them off for that site one after the other, until the problem
 is gone. When you have found the culprit, you might want to turn the rest on
 again.</P
><P
> If the above paragraph sounds gibberish to you, you might want to <A
HREF="configuration.html#ACTIONSFILE"
TARGET="_top"
>read more about the actions concept</A
>
 or even dive deep into the <A
HREF="appendix.html#ACTIONSANAT"
TARGET="_top"
