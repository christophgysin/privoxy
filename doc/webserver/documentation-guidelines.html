<h1>Documentation guideline:</h1>
<p>
All docs should be ...
<ul>
  <li>in a format that is widely used. I propose HTML.
  <li>we either
      <ul>
	<li>generate man pages from the documentation (let's _NOT_ write them manually), or 
	<li>we have a man page that points to the documentation (I propose
	    this option)
      </ul>
  <li>have a consistent layout
  <li>have a link to the latest version of the document (i.e. point to a URL at sf)
  <li>be consistent with the redirect script (i.e. the junkbuster program
      points via the redirect URL at sf to valid end-points in the document)
  <li>started from scratch but recycle parts from the original junkbuster documents
</ul>
