              Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.19 stable
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a beta release that introduces some new features and fixes a number of bugs, some of which are reasonably significant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.20 Beta ***

*** Version 3.0.19 Stable ***

- Bug fixes:
  - Prevent a segmentation fault when de-chunking buffered content.
    It could be triggered by malicious web servers if Privoxy was
    configured to filter the content and running on a platform
    where SIZE_T_MAX isn't larger than UINT_MAX, which probably
    includes most 32-bit systems. On those platforms, all Privoxy
    versions before 3.0.19 appear to be affected.
    To be on the safe side, this bug should be presumed to allow
    code execution as proving that it doesn't seems unrealistic.
  - Do not expect a response from the SOCKS4/4A server until it
    got something to respond to. This regression was introduced
    in 3.0.18 and prevented the SOCKS4/4A negotiation from working.
    Reported by qqqqqw in #3459781.

- General improvements:
  - Fix an off-by-one in an error message about connect failures.
  - Use a GNUMakefile variable for the webserver root directory and
    update the path. Sourceforge changed it which broke various
    web-related targets.
  - Update the CODE_STATUS description.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GNU GPLv2.

Privoxy is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

Helping hands and donations are welcome:

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), GNU/Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:


    *  Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
       alive independently from the client. Currently not available on all
       platforms.

    *  Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too,
       and the configure script detects it.

    *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
       and server headers.

    *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
       configure browsers individually.

    *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
       client headers.

    *  Can be chained with other proxies.

    *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
       http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
       tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

    *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
       invisible <quote>web-bugs</quote> and HTML annoyances, etc.)

    *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
       settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
       files won't overwrite individual user settings.

    *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
       files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

    *  GIF de-animation.

    *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

    *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
       "blocked" page).

    *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
    
    *  Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.
