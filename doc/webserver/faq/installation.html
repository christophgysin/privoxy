><P
> All browsers must be told to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 as a proxy by specifying the correct proxy address and port number 
 in the appropriate configuration area for the browser. See below.
 Also, you should flush your browser's memory and disk cache to get rid of any
 cached items.&#13;</P

>2.5. What is the proxy address of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>?</A
></H3
><P
>  If you set up the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
>
  (which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you have <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to run on a different port with the
  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>listen-address</I
> config option). 
 </P
><P
>  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
> in the boxes next to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP"</SPAN
>
  and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Secure"</SPAN
> (HTTPS) and then the number <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8118"</SPAN
>
  for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"port"</SPAN
>.  This tells your browser to send all web 
  requests to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> instead of directly to the 
  Internet.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment would be 
  same as above.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, or other Internet
  protocols.

All the ads are there. What's wrong?</A
></H3
><P
> Did you configure your browser to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
 as a proxy? It does not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing
 the browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify 
 that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is running, and your browser 
 is correctly configured by entering the special URL: 
 <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
>. This should give you 
 a banner that says <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"This is Privoxy"</SPAN
> and 
 access to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
> internal configuration. 
 If you see this, then you are good to go. If not, the browser or 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> are not set up correctly.&#13;</P
