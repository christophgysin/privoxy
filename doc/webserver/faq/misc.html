>4.1. How much does <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> slow my browsing down? This 
has to add extra time to browsing.</A
></H3
><P
> It should not slow you down any in real terms, and may actually help 
 speed things up since ads, banners and other junk are not being displayed.
 The actual processing time required by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> 
 itself for each page, is relatively small in the overall scheme of things,
 and happens very quickly. This is typically more than offset by time saved
 not downloading and rendering ad images.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Filtering"</SPAN
> via the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>filterfile</TT
> 
 mechanism may cause a perceived slowdown, since the entire page is buffered
 before displaying. See below.</P

NAME="LOADINGTIMES"
>4.2. I noticed considerable
delays in page requests compared to the old Junkbuster. What's wrong?</A
></H3
><P
>The entire page content must be loaded into memory in order for the filtering 
mechanism to work, and nothing is sent to the browser during this time. The
loading time does not really change in real numbers, but the feeling is
different, because most browsers are able to start rendering incomplete
content, giving the user a feeling of "it works". 
 </P
><P
> To modify the content of a page (i.e. make frames resizeable again, etc.) and
 not just replace ads, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> needs to download
 the entire page first, do its content magic and then send the page to the
 browser.</P

><DIV
CLASS="SECT2"

CLASS="SECT2"

NAME="CONFIGURL"
>4.3. What is the "http://p.p/"?</A
></H3
><P
>Since <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> sits between your web browser and the Internet, it can be
programmed to handle certain pages specially.</P
><P
> With recent versions of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> (version 2.9.x and
 greater), you can get some information about
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> and change some settings by going to
 <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
> or, equivalently, <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/</A
> (Note
 that p.p is far easier to type but may not work in some configurations. With
 the name change to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, this is changed from
 the previous http://i.j.b/ and earlier 2.9.x versions).</P
><P
> These pages are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> forwarded to a server on the
 Internet - instead they are handled by a special web server which is built in to
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> If you are not running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, then <A
HREF="http://p.p/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://p.p/</A
> will fail, and <A
HREF="http://config.privoxy.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://config.privoxy.org/</A
> will
 return a web page telling you you're not running
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> If you have version 2.0.2, then the equivalent is
 http://example.com/show-proxy-args (but you get far less information, and
 you should really consider upgrading to 2.9.15).</P

NAME="BLOCKLIST"
>4.4. Do you still maintain the blocklists?</A
></H3
><P
>    No, not by this name. The format of the blocklists has changed
    significantly in versions 2.9.x and later. This functionality 
    is done by the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"actions"</SPAN
> file now. See next question ...</P

NAME="IP"
>4.6. How can I hide my IP address?</A
></H3
><P
> You cannot hide your IP address with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> or any other software, since
the server needs to know your IP address to send the answers back to you.</P
><P
>Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out there, which
solve the problem by providing a further level of indirection between you and
the web server, shared by many people and thus letting your requests "drown"
in white noise of unrelated requests as far as user tracking is concerned.</P
><P
>Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available to the
authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal purposes. In fact
you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.</P
><P
>You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at <A
HREF="http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>multiproxy.org</A
> and many
more through Google.</P

NAME="AEN447"
>4.7. Can <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> guarantee I am anonymous?</A
></H3
><P
> No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but unless you
 are an expert on Internet security it would be safest to assume that
 everything you do on the Web can be traced back to you.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can remove various information about you,
 and allows <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>you</I
> more freedom  to decide which sites 
 you can trust, and what details you want to reveal. But it's still possible
 that web sites can find out who you are. Here's one way this can happen.</P
><P
> A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>NSClean</SPAN
>.</P
><P
> Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,
 Luke!</P

CLASS="SECT2"

NAME="AEN458"
>4.8. Might some things break because header information is
being altered?</A
></H3
><P
> Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what to
 display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be handled, 
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"USER AGENT"</SPAN
> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now is not
 recommended, since so many sites do look for this. You may get undesirable 
 results by changing this.</P
><P
> For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User Agent"</SPAN
> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"REFERER"</SPAN
> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"REFERER"</SPAN
> or cookie is provided, is another example. There are
 many, many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server.</P
><P
> If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your configuration 
 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.</P

speed up web browsing?</A
></H3
><P
> No, it does not have this ability at all. You want something like 
 <A

TARGET="_top"

> for this. And, yes, 
 before you ask, <SPAN

></H3

> Not in the way you mean, or in the way a true firewall can, or a proxy that
 has this specific capability. <SPAN

 protect your privacy, but not really protect you from intrusion attempts.</P

>4.11. The <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> logo that replaces ads is very blocky 
and ugly looking. Can't a better font be used?</A
></H3
><P
> This is not a font problem. The logo is an image that is created by 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> on the fly. So as to not waste 
 memory, the image is rather small. The blockiness comes when the 
 image is scaled to fill a largish area. There is not much to be done 
 about this, other than to use one of the other
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"imageblock"</SPAN
> directives: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pattern</I
>, 
 <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>blank</I

NAME="AEN490"
>4.12. I have large empty spaces now where ads used to be. 
Why?</A
></H3
><P
> It would be easy enough to just eliminate this space altogether, rather than
 fill it with blank space. But, this would create problems with many pages
 that use the overall size of the ad to help organize the page layout and
 position the various components of the page where they were intended to be.
 It is best left this way.</P

>4.13. How can <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> filter Secure (HTTPS) URLs?</A
></H3
><P
> This is a limitation since HTTPS transactions are encrypted SSL sessions
 between your browser and the secure site, and are meant to be reliably 
 <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>secure</I
> and private. This means that all cookies and HTTP
 header information are also encrypted from the time they leave your browser,
 to the site, and vice versa. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> does not
 try to unencrypt this information, so it just passes through as is.
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can still catch images and ads that
 are embedded in the SSL stream though.</P

>4.14. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

>. How 
secure is it? Do I need to take any special precautions?</A
></H3
><P
> There are no known exploits that might effect
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. On Unix-like systems, 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can run as a non-privileged 
 user, which is how we recommend it be run. Also, by default 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> only listens to requests 
 from <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"localhost"</SPAN
>. The server aspect of
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is not itself directly exposed to the
 Internet in this configuration. If you want to have
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> serve as a LAN proxy, this will have to
 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> config file. All LAN hosts can then use 
 this as their proxy address in the browser proxy configuration. In this way, 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will not listen on any external ports.
 Of course, a firewall is always good too. Better safe than sorry.</P
