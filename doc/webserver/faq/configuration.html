 It is meant to be a warning so that you know something has been blocked and
 an easy way for you to see why. These are handled differently than what has
 been defined explicitly as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"images"</SPAN
> (e.g. ads that are GIF image
 files). Depending on the URL itself, it is sometimes hard for
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to really know whether there is indeed an
 ad image there or not. And there are limitations as to what
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can do to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"fool"</SPAN
> the
 browser.</P
><P
> For instance, if the ad is in a frame, then it is embedded in the separate
 HTML page used for the frame. In this case, you cannot just substitute an
 aribitrary image (like we would for a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"blank"</SPAN
> image), for an HTML
 page. The browser is expecting an HTML page, and that is what it must have
 for frames. Such situations can be a little trickier to deal with, and 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> may show the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Blocked"</SPAN
> page,
 despite your best efforts.</P
><P
> If you want these to be treated as if they were images, so that they can be
 made invisible, you can try moving the offending URL from the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+block"</SPAN
> section to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+imageblock"</SPAN
> section of
 your actions file. Just be forewarned, if any URL is made
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"invisible"</SPAN
>, you may not have any inkling that something has
 been removed from that page, or why. If this approach does not work, then you are
 probably dealing with a frame (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ilayer"</SPAN
>), and the only thing
 that can go there is an HTML page of some sort.</P
><P
> To deal with this situation, you could modify the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>block</TT
>"</SPAN
> HTML template that is used by
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to display this, and make it something
 more to your liking. Currently, there is no configuration option for this.
 You will have to modify, or create your own page, and use this to replace
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>templates/blocked</TT
>, which is what
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> uses to display the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Blocked"</SPAN
>
 page.</P
><P
> Another way to deal with this is find why and where
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is blocking the frame, and 
 diable this. Then let the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+set-image-blocker"</SPAN
> action 
 handle the ad that is embedded in the frame's HTML page. </P
