   <SPAN

   2.9.x and later. Most of the older files will not work at all. This is 
   especially true of <TT

   will need to re-enter your old data into the new configuration structure.
   This is probably also a good recommendation even if upgrading from 2.9.x to
   3.x since there were many minor changes along the way.

 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 to be a warning so that you know something has been blocked and an easy way
 for you to see why. These are handled differently than what has been defined
 explicitly as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"images"</SPAN

 URL itself, it is sometimes hard for <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

 really know whether there is indeed an ad image there or not. And there are
 limitations as to what <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

><P
> For instance, if the ad is in a frame, then it is embedded in the separate
 HTML page used for the frame. In this case, you cannot just substitute an
 aribitray image (like we would for a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"blank"</SPAN
> image), for an HTML
 page. The browser is expecting an HTML page, and that is what it must have
 for frames. So this situation can be a little trickier to deal with, and 
 <SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

><P

 made invisible, you can try moving the offending URL from the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+block"</SPAN
> section to the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+imageblock"</SPAN
> section of
 your actions file. Just be forewarned, if any URL is made
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"invisible"</SPAN
>, you may not have any inkling that something has
 been removed from that page, or why. If this approach does not work, then you are
 probably dealing with a frame (or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"ilayer"</SPAN
>), and the only thing
 that can go there is an HTML page of some sort.</P
><P
> To deal with this situation, you could modify the
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>block</TT
>"</SPAN
> HTML template that is used by
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> to display this, and make it something
 more to your liking. Currently, there is no configuration option for this.
 You will have to modify, or create your own page, and use this to replace
 <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>templates/blocked</TT
>, which is what
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> uses to display the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Blocked"</SPAN
>
 page.</P
><P
> Another way to deal with this is find why and where
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is blocking the frame, and 
 diable this. Then let the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"+image-blocker"</SPAN
> action 
 handle the ad that is embedded in the frame's HTML page. </P
