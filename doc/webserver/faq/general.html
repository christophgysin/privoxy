  Development of this effort stopped some time ago as of version 2.0.2. Stefan
  Waldherr started the ijbswa project on <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/"
TARGET="_top"
>Sourceforge</A
> to
  rekindle development. Other developers subsequently joined with Stefan, and
  have since added many new features, refinements and enhancements. The result
  of this effort is <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> has evolved from the 
  <SPAN

  significantly at this point.

 share our ideals and goals.)</P

  The new <SPAN

  still manages cookies, and still helps protect your privacy. But, these are
  all enhanced, and many new features have been added, all in the same vein.

  users will notice right off the bat if you are upgrading from 
  <SPAN

  file does not exist any more. This is replaced by <SPAN

  files, such as <TT

<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

></H3
><P
>  When you connect to a web site with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, 
  you are really connecting to your locally running version of 
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
  intercepts your requests for the web page, and relays that to the 
  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"real"</SPAN
> web site. The web site sends the HTTP data stream 
  back to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, where
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> can work its magic before it 
  relays this data back to your web browser.
 </P
><P
>  Since <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> sits between you and the 
  WWW, it is in a position to intercept and completely manage all web traffic and 
  HTTP content before it gets to your browser.
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> uses various programming methods to do
  this, all of which is under your control via the various configuration
  files and options.
 </P

NAME="AEN123"
>1.6. How does <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> know what is
an ad, and what is not?</A
></H3
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> processes all the raw content of every 
 web page. So it reads everything on each page. It then compares this to the
 rules as set up in the configuration files, and looks for any matches to
 these rules. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> makes heavy use of
 <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"regular expressions"</SPAN
>. (If you are not familiar with regular
 expressions, it is explained briefly in <A
HREF="../user-manual/appendix.html"
TARGET="_top"
>the user manual</A
>.) Regular
 expressions facilitate matching of one text string against another, using
 wildcards to build complex patterns. So <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 will typically look for URLs and other content that match certain key words
 and expressions as defined in the configuration files. For instance a URL
 that contains <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"/banners"</SPAN
>, has a high probability of containing
 ad banners, and thus would be a prime candidate to have a matching rule.</P
><P
> So <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> will look for these kinds of obvious 
 looking culprits. And also, will use lists of known organizations that
 specialize in ads. Again, using complex patterns to match as many potential 
 combinations as possible since there tend to be many, many variations used by 
 advertisers, and new ones are being introduced all the time.</P

>1.7. Can <SPAN

>Privoxy</SPAN

This does not sound very scientific.</A
></H3
><P
> Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad rule
 accidentally block something by mistake. There is a good chance you may run 
 into such a situation at some point. It is tricky writing rules to cover
 every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.</P
><P
> But this should not be a big concern since the
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> configuration is very flexible, and
 includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be
 addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.

></H3
><P
>  Modern browsers do indeed have <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

  functionality as <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

  adequate for you. But <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  versatile and powerful, and can do a number of things that browsers just can't.
 </P
><P
>  In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or 
  have a LAN with multiple computers. This way all the configuration 
  is in one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration 
  for possibly many browsers.
