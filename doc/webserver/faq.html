<h3><a name="ip"></a>How can I hide my IP address?</h3>
<p>
You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster.

<h3><a name="image"></a>What is the imagefile (simage.ini, etc.) for?</h3>
<p>
Anytime the Junkbuster determines (with the help of the blocklist) that a URL
contains an advertisement, it has to decide whether this advertisement is an
image or not. The Junkbuster uses the imagefile for that purpose..
