 ===================================================================
 READ: Document Note: This file generates the README in the top level 
 source directory. It is generated as only a plain text file. The 
 current markup is not suitable for other formats. Build from 
 Makefile with 'make readme'.
 ===================================================================

 READ:

 ======================================================================
 NOTE: The left margin spacing is *important* when using 'literallayout'
 WYSISWYG!!! Don't mess this up!!! Careful with linebreaks too, ie 
 the para tag forces a linebreak. Tags need to be carefully placed as a result.
 ======================================================================

 For stable releases, change 
 
  entity % p-not-stable "INCLUDE" 
 
 to 
 
  entity % not-stable "IGNORE" 
  
 in the DTD at the top. This will toggle various text 'off'. BOTH
 MUST be toggled in this case.

 This README is included with <![%p-not-stable;[ the development version of]]>
 Privoxy &p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[, which will eventually become Privoxy v3.0 (and soon we
 hope!)]]>. See http://www.privoxy.org/ for more information. The current code
 level is &p-status;<![%p-not-stable;[, and seems stable to us :)]]>.

 NEWS! As of 03/24/02, the name of this project has been changed from
 ijbswa/Junkbuster to Privoxy. This is reflected in many of the included
 files. 
</para>
<para>

 the new package will delete any previously installed 'Junkbuster' packages.
</para>
<para>

 port is now 8118 due to conflicts with port 8000 assignment. You will need to

 privoxy [--help] [--version] [--no-daemon] [--pidfile PIDFILE] 
  [--user USER[.GROUP]] [config_file]
</para>
<para>
See the man page or user-manual for a brief explanation of each option.
</para>
<para>
 If no config_file is specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
 file named 'config' in the current directory (except Win32 which will look
 for 'config.txt'). If no config_file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.

 CONFIGURATION
-------------- </LiteralLayout>
</para>
<para>
 See: 'config', 'default.action', and 'default.filter'. There are several
 actions files included. These are all well commented. Most of the magic is in
 '*.action', and there are several of these included with varying degrees of
 aggressiveness. On Unix-like systems, these files are installed in
 /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever the executable itself is installed.
 There are many significant changes and advances since Junkbuster v2.0.x. The
 user-manual has a run down of configuration options, and examples:
 http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.
</para>
<para>
 Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at &lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;, or
 whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'. DEFAULT is
 localhost:8118.
</para>
<para>
 The default.action file can be configured via the web interface accessed via
 http://p.p/, as well other options.
</para>
<![%p-not-stable;[
<para>
 All configuration files are subject to unannounced changes during the
 development process.
</para>
]]>

<para>
 <LiteralLayout>

 DOCUMENTATION
--------------</LiteralLayout>
 There should be documentation in the 'doc' subdirectory<![%p-not-stable;[, but it
 is not completed at this point]]>. In particular, see the user-manual there,
 the faq, and those interested in Privoxy development, should look at
 developer-manual. 
</para>
<para>
 <![%p-not-stable;[
 The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
 may still be either comments in the source code, or the included
 configuration files. ]]>The source and configuration files are all well
 commented. The main configuration files are: 'config', 'default.action', and
 'default.filter'<![%p-not-stable;[ in the toplevel source directory]]>. There
 are several *.action files included, with varying levels of aggressiveness.
</para>

<para>
 Included documentation may vary according to platform and packager.
