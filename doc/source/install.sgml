 ========================================================================
 NOTE: Please read developer-manual/documentation.html before touching

 ========================================================================

 ===================================================================
 READ: Document Note: This file generates the INSTALL file in the top level
 source directory. It is generated as only a plain text file. The current
 markup is not suitable for other formats. Build from Makefile with 'make
 dok-readme'.
 ===================================================================

 READ:

 ======================================================================
 NOTE: The left margin spacing is *important* when using 'literallayout'
 WYSISWYG!!! Don't mess this up!!! Careful with linebreaks too, ie 
 the para tag forces a linebreak. Tags need to be carefully placed as a result
 to avoid extra blank lines, etc. 
 ======================================================================

 For stable releases, change 
 
  entity % p-not-stable "INCLUDE" 
 
 to 
 
  entity % p-not-stable "IGNORE" 
  
 in the DTD at the top. This will toggle various text 'off'. BOTH
 MUST be toggled in this case or you will get both text referencing 
 stable and unstable versions. You only want one or the other!
