<sect1 id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
 <application>Internet Junkbuster</application> is a web proxy with advanced
 filtering capabilities for protecting privacy, filtering web page content,
 managing cookies, controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and
 other obnoxious Internet Junk. <application>Junkbuster</application> has a
 very flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs
 and tastes. <application>Internet Junkbuster</application> has application
 for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
</para>

<para>
 This documentation is included with the current BETA version of
 <application>Internet Junkbuster</application> and is incomplete at this
 point. The most up to date reference for the time being is still the comments
 in the source files and in the individual configuration files. Development
 of version 3.0 is currently nearing completion, and includes many significant
 changes and enhancements over earlier versions. The target release date for
 stable v3.0 RSN.
</para>

<para>
 Since this is a BETA version, not all new features are well tested. This
 documentation may be slightly out of sync as a result. And there
 <emphasis>may be</emphasis> bugs, though hopefully not many!

<sect1 id="installation"><title>Installation</title>
<para>
 <application>Junkbuster</application> is available as raw source code, or
 pre-compiled binaries. See the <ulink
 url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/">Junkbuster Home Page</ulink>
 for current release info. <application>Junkbuster</application> is also available
 via <ulink
 url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ijbswa/current/">CVS</ulink>.
 This is the recommended approach at this time. But please be aware that CVS 
 is constantly changing, and it may break in mysterious ways.
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2 id="installation-source"><title>Source</title>
<para>
 For gzipped tar archives, unpack the source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 tar xzvf ijb_source_* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd ijb_source_2.9.10_beta
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need the CVS 
 package installed first. To download CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will create a directory named <filename>current/</filename>, which will 
 contain the source tree.
</para>

<para>
 Then, in either case, to build from tarball/CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 ./configure      (--help to see options)
 make             (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD) 
 su 
 make -n install  (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     (to really install)
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 For Redhat and SuSE Linux RPM packages, see below.
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 autoheader   [suggested for CVS source]
 autoconf     [suggested for CVS source]
 ./configure
 make redhat-dist

<para>
 <screen>
 rpm -Uvv /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686/junkbuster-2.9.10-1.i686.rpm
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will place the <application>Junkbuster</application> configuration 
 files in <filename>/etc/junkbuster/</filename>, and log files in

<para>
 <screen>
 autoheader   [suggested for CVS source]
 autoconf     [suggested for CVS source]
 ./configure
 make suse-dist
 </screen>
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect2 id="installation-os2"><title>OS/2</title>

<!--
Thanx David Schmidt!
-->

<para>
 <application>Junkbuster</application> is packaged in a WarpIN self-
 installing archive.  The self-installing program will be named depending
 on the release version, something like:
 <filename>ijbos2_setup_1.2.3.exe</filename>.  In order to install it, simply
 run this executable or double-click on its icon and follow the WarpIN
 installation panels.  A shadow of the <application>Junkbuster</application>
 executable will be placed in your startup folder so it will start 
 automatically whenever OS/2 starts.
</para>

<para>
 The directory you choose to install <application>Junkbuster</application>
 into will contain all of the configuration files.
</para>

<para>
 If you would like to build binary images on OS/2 yourself, you will need
 a few Unix-like tools: autoconf, autoheader and sh.  These tools will be
 used to create the required config.h file, which is not part of the 
 source distribution because it differs based on platform.  You will also
 need a compiler.
 The distribution has been created using IBM VisualAge compilers, but you
 can use any compiler you like.  GCC/EMX has the disadvantage of needing 
 to be single-threaded due to a limitation of EMX's implementation of the
 select() socket call.
</para>

<para>
 In addition to needing the source code distribution as outlined earlier,
 you will want to extract the <filename>os2seutp</filename> directory from CVS:
 <screen>
 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login          
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co os2setup
 cd current                                                                         
 </screen>
 This will create a directory named os2setup/, which will contain the
 <filename>Makefile.vac</filename> makefile and <filename>os2build.cmd</filename>
 which is used to completely create the binary distribution.  The sequence
 of events for building the executable for yourself goes something like this:
 <screen>
 cd current
 autoheader
 autoconf
 sh configure
 cd ..\os2setup
 nmake -f Makefile.vac
 </screen>
 You will see this sequence laid out in <filename>os2build.cmd</filename>.
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect1 id="configuration"><title>Junkbuster Configuration</title>
<para>
 For Unix, *BSD and Linux, all configuration files are located in
 <filename>/etc/junkbuster/</filename> by default. For MS Windows and OS/2,
 these are all in the same directory as the
 <application>Junkbuster</application> executable. The name and number of
 configuration files has changed from previous versions, and is subject to
 change as development progresses.
</para>

<para>
 The installed defaults provide a reasonable starting point, though possibly
 aggressive by some standards. For the time being, there are only three
 default configuration files (this will change in time):
</para>

<para>
 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>
     The main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename>
     on Linux, Unix, BSD, and OS/2, and <filename>config.txt</filename> on
     Windows. On Amiga, it is
     <filename>AmiTCP:db/junkbuster/config</filename>.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The <filename>ijb.action</filename> file is used  to define various 
    <quote>actions</quote> relating to images, banners, pop-ups, access
    restrictions, banners and cookies. There is a CGI based editor for this
    file that can be accessed via <ulink
    url="http://i.j.b">http://i.j.b</ulink>. This is the easiest method of
    configuring actions. (Other actions 
    files are included as well with differing levels of filtering 
    and blocking, e.g. <filename>ijb-basic.action</filename>.)
   </para>
  </listitem> 

  <listitem>
   <para>
    The <filename>re_filterfile</filename> file can be used to rewrite the raw
    page content, including text as well as embedded HTML and JavaScript.
   </para>
  </listitem> 

 </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
 <filename>ijb.action</filename> and <filename>re_filterfile</filename> 
 can use Perl style regular expressions for maximum flexibility. All files use
 the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> character to denote a comment. Such
 lines are not processed by <application>Junkbuster</application>. After
 making any changes, there is no need to restart
 <application>Junkbuster</application> in order for the changes to take
 effect. <application>Junkbuster</application> should detect such changes 
 automatically.
</para>

<para>
 While under development, the configuration content is subject to change. 
 The below documentation may not be accurate by the time you read this. 
 Also, what constitutes a <quote>default</quote> setting, may change, so 
 please check all your configuration files on important issues.
</para>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect2>
<title>The Main Configuration File</title>
<para>
 Again, the main configuration file is named <filename>config</filename> on
 Linux/Unix/BSD and OS/2, and <filename>config.txt</filename> on Windows.
 Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a list of
 values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces or tabs). For
 example:
</para>

<para>
 <literal>
  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
  <emphasis>blockfile blocklist.ini</emphasis>
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>

<para>
 Indicates that the blockfile is named <quote>blocklist.ini</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 A <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> indicates a comment.  Any part of a
 line following a <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> is ignored, except if
 the <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> is preceded by a
 <quote><literal>\</literal></quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Thus, by placing a <quote><literal>#</literal></quote> at the start of an
 existing configuration line, you can make it a comment and it will be treated
 as if it weren't there. This is called <quote>commenting out</quote> an
 option and can be useful to turn off features: If you comment out the
 <quote>logfile</quote> line, <application>junkbuster</application> will not
 log to a file at all. Watch for the <quote>default:</quote> section in each
 explanation to see what happens if the option is left unset (or commented
 out). 
</para>

<para>
 Long lines can be continued on the next line by using a
 <quote><literal>\</literal></quote> as the very last character.
</para>

<para>
 There are various aspects of <application>Junkbuster</application> behavior 
 that can be tuned.
</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->

<sect3>
<title>Defining Other Configuration Files</title>

<para>
 <application>Junkbuster</application> can use a number of other files to tell it
 what ads to block, what cookies to accept, etc.  This section of the
 configuration file tells <application>Junkbuster</application> where to find
 all those other files. 
</para>

<para>
 On <application>Windows</application>, <application>Junkbuster</application>
 looks for these files in the same directory as the executable.  On Unix and 
 OS/2, <application>Junkbuster</application> looks for these files in the current
 working directory. In either case, an absolute path name can be used to
 avoid problems.
</para>

<para>
 When development goes modular and multi-user, the blocker, filter, and
 per-user config will be stored in subdirectories of <quote>confdir</quote>.
 For now, only <filename>confdir/templates</filename> is used for storing HTML
 templates for CGI results. 
</para>

<para>
 Note that all file specifications below are relative to 
 the above two directories!
</para>

<para>
 The <quote>ijb.action</quote> file contains patterns to specify the actions to
 apply to requests for each site. Default: Cookies to and from all
 destinations are kept only during the current browser session (i.e. they 
 are not saved to disk). Pop-ups are disabled for all sites. All sites are
 filtered if <quote>re_filterfile</quote> specified. No sites are blocked. An
 empty image is displayed for filtered ads and other images (formerly
 <quote>tinygif</quote>). The syntax of this file is explained in detail <link
 linkend="actionsfile">below</link>.

</para>

<para>
 The <quote>re_filterfile</quote> file contains content modification rules.
 These rules permit powerful changes on the content of Web pages, e.g., you
 could disable your favorite JavaScript annoyances, rewrite the actual
 content, or just have some fun replacing <quote>Microsoft</quote> with
 <quote>MicroSuck</quote> wherever it appears on a Web page. Default: No
 content modification, or whatever the developers are playing with :-/

</para>

<para>
 The logfile is where all logging and error messages are written. The logfile
 can be useful for tracking down a problem with
 <application>Junkbuster</application> (e.g., it's not blocking an ad you
 think it should block) but in most cases you probably will never look at it.
</para>

<para>
 Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably want to
 periodically remove it.  On Unix systems, you can do this with a cron job
 (see <quote>man cron</quote>). For Redhat, a <command>logrotate</command> 
 script has been included.
</para>

<para>
 On SuSE Linux systems, you can place a line like <quote>/var/log/junkbuster.*
 +1024k 644 nobody.nogroup</quote> in <filename>/etc/logfiles</filename>, with
 the effect that cron.daily will automatically archive, gzip, and empty the
 log, when it exceeds 1M size.
</para>

<para>
 Default: Log to the a file named <filename>logfile</filename>. 
 Comment out to disable logging.

 The <quote>jarfile</quote> defines where
 <application>Junkbuster</application> stores the cookies it intercepts.  Note
 that if you use a <quote>jarfile</quote>, it may grow quite large. Default:
 Don't store intercepted cookies.

<para>
 If you specify a <quote>trustfile</quote>,
 <application>Junkbuster</application> will only allow access to sites that
 are named in the trustfile. You can also mark sites as trusted referrers,
 with the effect that access to untrusted sites will be granted, if a link
 from a trusted referrer was used. The link target will then be added to the
 <quote>trustfile</quote>. This is a very restrictive feature that typical
 users most probably want to leave disabled. Default: Disabled, don't use the
 trust mechanism.

 If you use the trust mechanism, it is a good idea to write up some on-line
 documentation about your blocking policy and to specify the URL(s) here. They

 display links on the <quote>untrusted</quote> info page.

 This part of the configuration file contains options that control how
 <application>Junkbuster</application> operates.

<para>
 <quote>Admin-address</quote> should be set to the email address of the proxy
 administrator. It is used in many of the proxy-generated pages. Default:

<para>
 <quote>Proxy-info-url</quote> can be set to a URL that contains more info
 about this <application>Junkbuster</application> installation, it's
 configuration and policies. It is used in many of the proxy-generated pages
 and its use is highly recommended in multi-user installations, since your
 users will want to know why certain content is blocked or modified. Default:
 Don't show a link to on-line documentation.

</para>

<para>
 <quote>Listen-address</quote> specifies the address and port where
 <application>Junkbuster</application> will listen for connections from your
 Web browser.  The default is to listen on the localhost port 8000, and
 this is suitable for most users.  (In your web browser, under proxy
 configuration, list the proxy server as <quote>localhost</quote> and the
 port as <quote>8000</quote>).
</para>

<para>
 If you already have another service running on port 8000, or if you want to
 serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your local network) as well, you
 will need to override the default. The syntax is 
 <quote>listen-address [&lt;ip-address&gt;]:&lt;port&gt;</quote>. If you leave
 out the IP address, <application>junkbuster</application> will bind to all
 interfaces (addresses) on your machine and may become reachable from the
 Internet. In that case, consider using access control lists (acl's) (see
 <quote>aclfile</quote> above), or a firewall.
</para>

<para>
 For example, suppose you are running <application>Junkbuster</application> on
 a machine which has the address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network
 (192.168.0.0) and has another outside connection with a different address.
 You want it to serve requests from inside only:

 The debug option sets the level of debugging information to log in the

 For content filtering, i.e. the <quote>+filter</quote> and

 The <application>buffer-limit</application> option lets you set the maximum

<title>Access Control List (ACL)</title>
<para>
 Access controls are included at the request of some ISPs and systems
 administrators, and are not usually needed by individual users. Please note
 the warnings in the FAQ that this proxy is not intended to be a substitute
 for a firewall or to encourage anyone to defer addressing basic security
 weaknesses.
</para>

<para>
 If no access settings are specified, the proxy talks to anyone that
 connects. If any access settings file are specified, then the proxy
 talks only to IP addresses permitted somewhere in this file and not
 denied later in this file.
</para>

<para>
 Summary -- if using an ACL:
</para>

 <simplelist>
  <member>
   Client must have permission to receive service.
  </member>
 </simplelist>
 <simplelist>
  <member>
   LAST match in ACL wins.
  </member>
 </simplelist>
 <simplelist>
  <member>
   Default behavior is to deny service.
  </member>
 </simplelist>

<para>
 The syntax for an entry in the Access Control List is:
</para>

</para>

<para>

  <msgtext> 
   <literallayout>
 <emphasis>ACTION</emphasis>      = <quote>permit-access</quote> or <quote>deny-access</quote>

 <emphasis>SRC_ADDR</emphasis>    = client hostname or dotted IP address
 <emphasis>SRC_MASKLEN</emphasis> = number of bits in the subnet mask for the source

 <emphasis>DST_ADDR</emphasis>    = server or forwarder hostname or dotted IP address
 <emphasis>DST_MASKLEN</emphasis> = number of bits in the subnet mask for the target
   </literallayout>
  </msgtext> 
 </literal>
</para>


<para> 
 The field separator (FS) is whitespace (space or tab).
</para>

<para>
 IMPORTANT NOTE: If the <application>junkbuster</application> is using a
 forwarder (see below) or a gateway for a particular destination URL, the
 <literal>DST_ADDR</literal> that is examined is the address of the forwarder
 or the gateway and <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> the address of the ultimate
 target. This is necessary because it may be impossible for the local
 <application>Junkbuster</application> to determine the address of the
 ultimate target (that's often what gateways are used for).
</para>

<para>
 Here are a few examples to show how the ACL features work:
</para>

<para>
 <quote>localhost</quote> is OK -- no DST_ADDR implies that
 <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> destination addresses are OK:

 An ISP may want to provide a <application>Junkbuster</application> that is

 private content to hosts on its internal network (i.e. its own subscribers).
 Say, for instance the ISP owns the Class-B IP address block 123.124.0.0 (a 16

<title>Forwarding</title>

<para>
 This feature allows chaining of HTTP requests via multiple proxies.
 It can be used to better protect privacy and confidentiality when
 accessing specific domains by routing requests to those domains
 to a special purpose filtering proxy such as lpwa.com. Or to use 
 a caching proxy to speed up browsing.
</para>

<para>
 It can also be used in an environment with multiple networks to route
 requests via multiple gateways allowing transparent access to multiple
 networks without having to modify browser configurations.
</para>

<para>
 Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. <application>Junkbuster</application>
 SOCKS 4 and SOCKS 4A. The difference is that SOCKS 4A will resolve the target
 hostname using DNS on the SOCKS server, not our local DNS client.

<title>The Actions File</title>

<para>
 The <quote>ijb.action</quote> file (formerly
 <filename>actionsfile</filename>) is used to define what actions
 <application>Junkbuster</application> takes, and thus determines how images,
 cookies and various other aspects of HTTP content and transactions are
 handled. Images can be anything you want, including ads, banners, or just
 some obnoxious image that you would rather not see. Cookies can be accepted
 or rejected, or accepted only during the current browser session (i.e. 
 not written to disk). Changes to <filename>ijb.action</filename> should 
 be immediately visible to <application>Junkbuster</application> without 
 the need to restart.
</para>

<para>
 To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
 compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
 applicable actions for the URL is incrementally updated. You can trace
 this process by visiting <ulink
 url="http://i.j.b/show-url-info">http://i.j.b/show-url-info</ulink>. 
</para>

<para>
 The actions file can be edited with a browser by loading 
 <ulink url="http://i.j.b/">http://i.j.b/</ulink>, and then select 
 <quote>Edit Actions</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 There are four types of lines in this file: comments (begin with a 
 <quote>#</quote> character), actions, aliases and patterns, all of which are
 explained below, as well as the configuration file syntax that 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> understands.

</para>


<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect3>
<title>URL Domain and Path Syntax</title>
<para>
 Generally, a pattern has the form &lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;, where both the
 &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;path&gt; part are optional. If you only specify a
 domain part, the <quote>/</quote> can be left out:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com</emphasis> - is a domain only pattern and will match any request to
 <quote>www.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/</emphasis> - means exactly the same.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/index.html</emphasis> - matches only the single
 document <quote>/index.html</quote> on <quote>www.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>/index.html</emphasis> - matches the document <quote>/index.html</quote>, regardless of
 the domain.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>index.html</emphasis> - matches nothing, since it would be
 interpreted as a domain name and there is no top-level domain called
 <quote>.html</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: if the
 domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end. 
 For example:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>.example.com</emphasis> - matches any domain that <emphasis>ENDS</emphasis> in 
 <quote>.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.</emphasis> - matches any domain that <emphasis>STARTS</emphasis> with
 <quote>www</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names
 themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wild-cards: <quote>*</quote>
 stands for zero or more arbitrary characters, <quote>?</quote> stands for
 any single character. And you can define character classes in square
 brackets and they can be freely mixed:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>ad*.example.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>adserver.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>ads.example.com</quote>, etc but not <quote>sfads.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>*ad*.example.com</emphasis> - matches all of the above, and then some.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>.?pix.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>www.ipix.com</quote>,
 <quote>pictures.epix.com</quote>, <quote>a.b.c.d.e.upix.com</quote>, etc. 
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www[1-9a-ez].example.com</emphasis> - matches <quote>www1.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>www4.example.com</quote>, <quote>wwwd.example.com</quote>, 
 <quote>wwwz.example.com</quote>, etc., but <emphasis>not</emphasis> 
 <quote>wwww.example.com</quote>.
</para>

<para>
 If <application>Junkbuster</application> was compiled with
 <quote>pcre</quote> support (default), Perl compatible regular expressions
 can be used. See the <filename>pcre/docs/</filename> directory or <quote>man
 perlre</quote> (also available on  <ulink
 url="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlre.html</ulink>)
 for details. A brief discussion of regular expressions is in the 
 <link linkend="regex">Appendix</link>. For instance:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.jpe?g</emphasis>  - would match a URL from any
 domain, with any path that includes <quote>advert</quote> followed
 immediately by one or more digits, then a <quote>.</quote> and ending in
 either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>. So we match
 <quote>example.com/ads/advert2.jpg</quote>, and
 <quote>www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.jpeg</quote>, but not
 <quote>www.example.com/ads/banners/advert39.gif</quote> (no gifs in the
 example pattern).
</para>

<para>
 Please note that matching in the path is case
 <emphasis>INSENSITIVE</emphasis> by default, but you can switch to case
 sensitive at any point in the pattern by using the 
 <quote>(?-i)</quote> switch:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis>www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.*</emphasis> - will match only
 documents whose path starts with <quote>PaTtErN</quote> in
 <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> this capitalization.
</para>

<title>Actions</title>
<para>
 Actions are enabled if preceded with a <quote>+</quote>, and disabled if 
 preceded with a <quote>-</quote>. Actions are invoked by enclosing the 
 action name in curly braces (e.g. {+some_action}), followed by a list of 
 URLs to which the action applies. There are three classes of actions:

   is used as the replacement. If <quote>last</quote> is given, the last frame

   Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they
   will link to some script on their own server, giving the destination as a
   parameter, which will then redirect you to the final target. URLs resulting
   from this scheme typically look like:
   http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else.
  </para>
  <para>
   Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the
   URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing more traceable,
   since the server from which you follow such a link can see where you go to.
   Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your browser
   ask the server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds the
   advertisers.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <quote>+fast-redirects</quote> option enables interception of these
   requests by <application>Junkbuster</application>, who will cut off all but
   the last valid URL in the request and send a local redirect back to your
   browser without contacting the remote site.

   By default (i.e. in the absence of a <quote>+limit-connect</quote>
   action), <application>Junkbuster</application> will only allow CONNECT
   requests to port 443, which is the standard port for https as a

  </para>
 
  <para>
   The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
   (https:// URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy
   connects to the server on the specified port, and then short-circuits
   its connections to the client <emphasis>and</emphasis> to the remote proxy.
   This can be a big security hole, since CONNECT-enabled proxies can

 Custom <quote>actions</quote>, known to <application>Junkbuster</application>
 as <quote>aliases</quote>, can be defined by combining other <quote>actions</quote>.
 These can in turn be invoked just like the built-in <quote>actions</quote>.
 Currently, an alias can contain any character except space, tab, <quote>=</quote>,
 <quote>{</quote> or <quote>}</quote>. But please use only <quote>a</quote>-
 <quote>z</quote>, <quote>0</quote>-<quote>9</quote>, <quote>+</quote>, and
 <quote>-</quote>. Alias names are not case sensitive, and 
 <emphasis>must be defined  before anything</emphasis> else in the
 <filename>ijb.action</filename>file ! And there can only be one set of
 <quote>aliases</quote> defined.

<para>
 If no configuration file is specified on the command line,
 <application>Junkbuster</application> will look for a file named
 <filename>config</filename> in the current directory. Except on Amiga where
 it will look for <filename>AmiTCP:db/junkbuster/config</filename> and Win32
 where it will try <filename>config.txt</filename>. If no file is specified 
 on the command line and no default configuration file can be found, 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> will fail to start.
</para>

<para>
 Be sure your browser is set to use the proxy which is by default at
 localhost, port 8000. With <application>Netscape</application> (and

 check <quote>Use Proxy</quote> and fill in the appropriate info (Address:
 localhost, Port: 8000). Include if HTTPS proxy support too.
</para>

<para>
 The included default configuration files should give a reasonable starting
 point, though may be somewhat aggressive in blocking junk. You will probably
 want to keep an eye out for sites that require persistent cookies, and add these to
 <filename>ijb.action</filename> as needed. By default, most of these will
 be accepted only during the current browser session, until you add them to
 the configuration. If you want the browser to handle this instead, you will
 need to edit <filename>ijb.action</filename> and disable this feature. If you
 use more than one browser, it would make more sense to let
 <application>Junkbuster</application> handle this. In which case, the
 browser(s) should be set to accept all cookies.
</para>

<para>
 If a particular site shows problems loading properly, try adding it 
 to the <literal>{fragile}</literal> section of
 <filename>ijb.action</filename>. This will turn off most actions for 
 this site.
</para>

<para>
 HTTP/1.1 support is not fully implemented. If browsers that
 support HTTP/1.1 (like <application>Mozilla</application> or recent versions
 of I.E.) experience problems, you might try to force HTTP/1.0 compatibility.
 For Mozilla, look under <literal>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Debug -&gt;
 Networking</literal>. Or set the <quote>+downgrade</quote> config option in
 <filename>ijb.action</filename>.
</para>

<para>
 After running <application>Junkbuster</application> for a while, you can 
 start to fine tune the configuration to suit your personal, or site, 
 preferences and requirements. There are many, many aspects that can 
 be customized. <quote>Actions</quote> (as specified in <filename>ijb.action</filename>) 
 can be adjusted by pointing your browser to 
 <ulink url="http://i.j.b/">http://i.j.b/</ulink>, 
 and then follow the link to <quote>edit the actions list</quote>. 
 (This is an internal page and does not require Internet access.)

<para>
 In fact, various aspects of <application>Junkbuster</application>
 configuration can be viewed from this page, including 
 current configuration parameters, source code version numbers, 
 the browser's request headers, and <quote>actions</quote> that apply 
 to a given URL. In addition to the <filename>ijb.action</filename> file 
 editor mentioned above, <application>Junkbuster</application> can also 
 be turned <quote>on</quote> and <quote>off</quote> from this page.

<para>
 If you encounter problems, please verify it is a
 <application>Junkbuster</application> bug, by disabling
 <application>Junkbuster</application>, and then trying the same page. 
 Also, try another browser if possible to eliminate browser or site 
 problems. Before reporting it as a bug, see if there is not a configuration

<sect2 id="regex">
<title>Regular Expressions</title>
<para>
 <application>Junkbuster</application> can use <quote>regular expressions</quote> 
 in various config files. Assuming support for <quote>pcre</quote> (Perl
 Compatible Regular Expressions) is compiled in, which is the default. Such
 configuration directives do not require regular expressions, but they can be
 used to increase flexibility by matching a pattern with wild-cards against
 URLs.
</para>

<para>
 If you are reading this, you probably don't understand what <quote>regular
 expressions</quote> are, or what they can do. So this will be a very brief
 introduction only. A full explanation would require a book ;-)
</para>

<para>
 <quote>Regular expressions</quote> is a way of matching one character
 expression against another to see if it matches or not. One of the
 <quote>expressions</quote> is a literal string of readable characters
 (letter, numbers, etc), and the other is a complex string of literal
 characters combined with wild-cards, and other special characters, called
 meta-characters. The <quote>meta-characters</quote> have special meanings and
 are used to build the complex pattern to be matched against. Perl Compatible
 Regular Expressions is an enhanced form of the regular expression language
 with backward compatibility.
</para>

<para>
 To make a simple analogy, we do something similar when we use wild-card
 characters when listing files with the <command>dir</command> command in DOS. 
 <literal>*.*</literal> matches all filenames. The <quote>special</quote>
 character here is the asterisk which matches any and all characters. We can be
 more specific and use <literal>?</literal> to match just individual
 characters. So <quote>dir file?.text</quote> would match
 <quote>file1.txt</quote>, <quote>file2.txt</quote>, etc. We are pattern
 matching, using a similar technique to <quote>regular expressions</quote>!
</para>

<para>
 Regular expressions do essentially the same thing, but are much, much more
 powerful. There are many more <quote>special characters</quote> and ways of 
 building complex patterns however. Let's look at a few of the common ones,
 and then some examples:
</para>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>.</emphasis> - Matches any single character, e.g. <quote>a</quote>,
  <quote>A</quote>, <quote>4</quote>, <quote>:</quote>, or <quote>@</quote>.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>?</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or ONE
  times. Either/or.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>+</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ONE or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>*</emphasis> - The preceding character or expression is matched ZERO or MORE
  times.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>\</emphasis> - The <quote>escape</quote> character denotes that
  the following character should be taken literally. This is used where one of the 
  special characters (e.g. <quote>.</quote>) needs to be taken literally and
  not as a special meta-character.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>[]</emphasis> - Characters enclosed in brackets will be matched if
  any of the enclosed characters are encountered.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>()</emphasis> - parentheses are used to group a sub-expression,
  or multiple sub-expressions.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>|</emphasis> - The <quote>bar</quote> character works like an
  <quote>or</quote> conditional statement. A match is successful if the
  sub-expression on either side of <quote>|</quote> matches.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<simplelist>
 <member>
  <emphasis>s/string1/string2/g</emphasis> - This is used to rewrite strings of text. 
  <quote>string1</quote> is replaced by <quote>string2</quote> in this
  example.
 </member>
</simplelist>

<para>
 These are just some of the ones you are likely to use when matching URLs with 
 <application>Junkbuster</application>, and is a long way from a definitive
 list. This is enough to get us started with a few simple examples which may
 be more illuminating:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/banners/.*</literal></emphasis> - A  simple example
 that uses the common combination of <quote>.</quote> and <quote>*</quote> to 
 denote any character, zero or more times. In other words, any string at all.
 So we start with a literal forward slash, then our regular expression pattern 
 (<quote>.*</quote>) another literal forward slash, the string
 <quote>banners</quote>, another forward slash, and lastly another
 <quote>.*</quote>. We are building 
 a directory path here. This will match any file with the path that has a
 directory named <quote>banners</quote> in it. The <quote>.*</quote> matches
 any characters, and this could conceivably be more forward slashes, so it
 might expand into a much longer looking path. For example, this could match:
 <quote>/eye/hate/spammers/banners/annoy_me_please.gif</quote>, or just
 <quote>/banners/annoying.html</quote>, or almost an infinite number of other
 possible combinations, just so it has <quote>banners</quote> in the path
 somewhere.
</para>

<para>
 A now something a little more complex:
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))?/</literal></emphasis> - 
 We have several literal forward slashes again (<quote>/</quote>), so we are
 building another expression that is a file path statement. We have another 
 <quote>.*</quote>, so we are matching against any conceivable sub-path, just so
 it matches our expression. The only true literal that <emphasis>must
 match</emphasis> our pattern is <application>adv</application>, together with
 the forward slashes. What comes after the <quote>adv</quote> string is the
 interesting part. 
</para>

<para>
 Remember the <quote>?</quote> means the preceding expression (either a
 literal character or anything grouped with <quote>(...)</quote> in this case)
 can exist or not, since this means either zero or one match. So
 <quote>((er)?ts?|ertis(ing|ements?))</quote> is optional, as are the
 individual sub-expressions: <quote>(er)</quote>,
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, and the <quote>s</quote>. The <quote>|</quote>
 means <quote>or</quote>. We have two of those. For instance, 
 <quote>(ing|ements?)</quote>, can expand to match either <quote>ing</quote> 
 <emphasis>OR</emphasis> <quote>ements?</quote>. What is being done here, is an
 attempt at matching as many variations of <quote>advertisement</quote>, and 
 similar, as possible. So this would expand to match just <quote>adv</quote>,
 or <quote>advert</quote>, or <quote>adverts</quote>, or
 <quote>advertising</quote>, or <quote>advertisement</quote>, or
 <quote>advertisements</quote>. You get the idea. But it would not match 
 <quote>advertizements</quote> (with a <quote>z</quote>). We could fix that by
 changing our regular expression to: 
 <quote>/.*/adv((er)?ts?|erti(s|z)(ing|ements?))?/</quote>, which would then match
 either spelling.
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>/.*/advert[0-9]+\.(gif|jpe?g)</literal></emphasis> - Again 
 another path statement with forward slashes. Anything in the square brackets 
 <quote>[]</quote> can be matched. This is using <quote>0-9</quote> as a
 shorthand expression to mean any digit one through nine. It is the same as
 saying <quote>0123456789</quote>. So any digit matches. The <quote>+</quote>
 means one or more of the preceding expression must be included. The preceding 
 expression here is what is in the square brackets -- in this case, any digit 
 one through nine. Then, at the end, we have a grouping: <quote>(gif|jpe?g)</quote>. 
 This includes a <quote>|</quote>, so this needs to match the expression on
 either side of that bar character also. A simple <quote>gif</quote> on one side, and the other
 side will in turn match either <quote>jpeg</quote> or <quote>jpg</quote>,
 since the <quote>?</quote> means the letter <quote>e</quote> is optional and
 can be matched once or not at all. So we are building an expression here to
 match image GIF or JPEG type image file. It must include the literal
 string <quote>advert</quote>, then one or more digits, and a <quote>.</quote>
 (which is now a literal, and not a special character, since it is escaped
 with <quote>\</quote>), and lastly either <quote>gif</quote>, or
 <quote>jpeg</quote>, or <quote>jpg</quote>. Some possible matches would
 include: <quote>//advert1.jpg</quote>,
 <quote>/nasty/ads/advert1234.gif</quote>,
 <quote>/banners/from/hell/advert99.jpg</quote>. It would not match
 <quote>advert1.gif</quote> (no leading slash), or
 <quote>/adverts232.jpg</quote> (the expression does not include an
 <quote>s</quote>), or <quote>/advert1.jsp</quote> (<quote>jsp</quote> is not
 in the expression anywhere).
</para>

<para>
 <emphasis><literal>s/microsoft(?!.com)/MicroSuck/i</literal></emphasis> - This is 
 a substitution. <quote>MicroSuck</quote> will replace any occurrence of 
 <quote>microsoft</quote>.  The <quote>i</quote> at the end of the expression
 means ignore case. The <quote>(?!.com)</quote> means 
 the match should fail if <quote>microsoft</quote> is followed by
 <quote>.com</quote>. In other words, this acts like a <quote>NOT</quote>
 modifier. In case this is a hyperlink, we don't want to break it ;-).
</para>

<para>
 We are barely scratching the surface of regular expressions here so that you
 can understand the default <application>Junkbuster</application>
 configuration files, and maybe use this knowledge to customize your own
 installation. There is much, much more that can be done with regular
 expressions. Now that you know enough to get started, you can learn more on
 your own :/
