<para>
 There are several ways to install <application>Privoxy</application>.
</para>

<para>
 To build <application>Privoxy</application> from source, 
 autoconf and GNU make (gmake) are required. Source is available as gzipped
 tar archives. For this, first unpack the source: 
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 tar xzvf privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>-src* [.tgz or .tar.gz]
 cd privoxy-&p-version;<![%p-not-stable;[-beta]]>
 </screen>
</para>


<para>
 For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need the CVS 
 package installed first. Note CVS source is development quality, 
 and may not be stable, or well tested. To download CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current
  cd current
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 This will create a directory named <filename>current/</filename>, which will 
 contain the source tree.
</para>

<para>
 Then, in either case, to build from unpacked tarball or CVS source:
</para>

<para>
 <screen>
 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure      (--help to see options)
 make             (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD) 
 su 
 make -n install  (to see where all the files will go)
 make install     (to really install)
 </screen>
</para>

<para>
 Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 
 <quote><command>make redhat-dist</command></quote> or
 <quote><command>make suse-dist</command></quote> from unpacked sources. You
 will need to run <quote><command>autoconf; autoheader;
 ./configure</command></quote> beforehand. *BSD will require gmake (from
 <ulink url="http://gnu.org">http://gnu.org</ulink>).
