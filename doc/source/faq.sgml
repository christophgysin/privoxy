<sect3 id="browseconfig"> <title>Why can I change the configuration with a
browser? Does that not raise security issues?</title>
 <para>
What I don't understand, is how I can browser edit the config file as a
regular user, while the whole /etc/junkbuster hierarchy belongs to the user
"junkbuster", with only 644 perms.
 </para>
 <para>
When you use the browser-based editor, JunkBuster itself is writing to the
config files.  Because JunkBuster is running as the user "junkbuster", it can
update the config files.
 </para>
 <para>
If you don't like this, setting "enable-edit-actions 0" in the config file
will disable the browser-based editor.  If you're that paranoid, you should
also consider setting "enable-remote-toggle 0" to prevent browser-based
enabling/disabling of JunkBuster.
 </para>
 <para>
Note that normally only local users can connect to JunkBuster, so this is not
(normally) a security problem.

<sect3 id="loadingtimes"><title>I noticed considerable
delays in page requests compared to the old IJB. What's wrong?</title>
<para>
Using the default filtering configuration, I noticed considerable delays in
page requests compared to the old IJB. Loading pages with large contents
seemed to take forever, then suddenly delivering all the content at once.
 </para>
<para>
The whole content must be loaded in order to filter, and nothing is is
sent to the browser during this time. The loading time does not really
change in real numbers, but the feeling is different, because most
browsers are able to start rendering incomplete content, giving the
user a feeling of "it works". 
 </para>
<para>
To modify the content of a page (i.e. make frames resizeable again, etc.) and
not just replace ads, the Internet Junkbuster needs to download the entire
page first, do its content magic and then send the page to the browser.
</para>
</sect3>


<sect3 id="configurl"><title>What is the "http://i.j.b/"?</title>
<para>
Since JunkBuster sits between your web browser and the Internet, it can be
programmed to handle certain pages specially.
</para>

<para>
With recent versions of JunkBuster (version 2.9.x), you can get some
information about JunkBuster and change some settings by going to
http://i.j.b/ or, equivalently, http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
(Note that i.j.b is far easier to type but may not work in some
configurations).
</para>

<para>
These pages are *not* forwarded to a server on the internet - instead they are
handled by a special web server which is built in to JunkBuster.
</para>

<para>
If you are not running JunkBuster, then http://i.j.b/ will fail, and
http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/ will return a web page telling you
you're not running JunkBuster.
</para>

<para>
If you have version 2.0.2, then the equivalent is
http://example.com/show-proxy-args (but you get far less information, and you
should really consider upgrading to 2.9.x).
</para>

<para>
   Fillme.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="jointeam"><title>I would like to help you, what do I do?</title>
<para>
   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new developers,
   RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account on sourceforge.net
   and mail your id to the developer mailing list. Once we have added you to
   the team, you'll have write access to the CVS repository, and we'll find a
   suitable task for you together.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="blocklist"><title>Do you still maintain the blocklists?</title>
<para>
    No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the versions
    2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will again be
    blocklists that you can update automatically.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="newads"><title>How can I submit new ads?</title>
<para>
    As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
    have released the new version, there will again be a form on the website,
    which you can use to contribute new ads.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="ip"><title>How can I hide my IP address?</title>
<para>
 You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="image"><title>What is the imagefile (simage.ini, etc.) for?</title>
<para>
 Anytime the Junkbuster determines (with the help of the blocklist) that a URL
 contains an advertisement, it has to decide whether this advertisement is an
 image or not. The Junkbuster uses the imagefile for that purpose.
</para>
