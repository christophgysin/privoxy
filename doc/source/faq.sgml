Junkbuster</application> is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities
for protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies,
controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious
Internet Junk. Junkbuster has a very flexible configuration and can be
customized to suit individual needs and tastes. <application>Internet
Junkbuster</application> has application for both stand-alone systems and
multi-user networks.

<sect2 id="general"><title>General Information</title>

<sect3 id="newjb"><title>What is this new <application>Junkbuster</application>?</title>
 <para>
  The original <application>Junkbuster</application> was a product of 
  Junkbusters Corporation (tm). Development of this effort stopped 
  as of version 2.0.2. Stefan Walherr started the ijbswa project on 
  <ulink url="http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</ulink> to 
  rekindle development. Other developers subsequently joined with 
  Stefan, and have since added many new features and enhancements.
 </para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="differs"><title>How does it differ from the old <application>Junkbuster?</application></title>
 <para>
   All the old features remain. The new <application>Junkbuster</application> 
   still blocks ads and banners, still manages cookies, and protects 
   privacy. But, these are all enhanced, and many new features have been 
   added, all in the same vein.
 </para>
 <para>
  The configuration has changed significantly. This is something that users
  will notice right off the bat. The <quote>blocklist</quote> file does 
  not exist any more. This is replaced by <quote>actions</quote>
  files, such as <filename>ijb.actions</filename>. This is where most of 
  the per site configuration is now.

<sect3 id="proxymoron"><title>How does <application>Junkbuster</application>
 work? What is a <quote>proxy</quote>?</title>
 <para>
  When you connect to a web site with <application>Junkbuster</application>, 
  you are really connecting to your locally running version of 
  <application>Junkbuster</application>. <application>Junkbuster</application>
  intercepts your requests for the web page, and relays that to the 
  <quote>real</quote> web site. The web site sends the HTTP data stream 
  back to <application>Junkbuster</application>, where
  <application>Junkbuster</application> can work its magic before it 
  relays this data back to your web browser.

 </para>

 <para>
  Since <application>Junkbuster</application> sits between you and the 
  WWW, it is in a position to intercept and completely manage all web traffic and 
  HTTP content before it gets to your browser.
  <application>Junkbuster</application> uses various programming methods to do
  this, all of which is under your control via the various configuration
  files.

 </para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="browsers2"><title>My browser does the same things as 
Junkbuster. Why should I use Junkbuster at all?</title>
 <para>
  Modern browsers do indeed have <emphasis>some</emphasis> of the same
  functionality as <application>Junkbuster</application>. Maybe this is
  adequate for you. But <application>Junkbuster</application> is much more
  verstatile and powerful, and can do a number of things that browsers just can't.
 </para>
 <para>
  In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or 
  have a LAN with multiple computers. This way all the configuration 
  is in one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration 
  for possibly many browsers.

 </para>
</sect3>



<sect3 id="license"><title>Is there is a license or fee? What about a 
warranty? Registration?</title>
 <para>
  <application>Junkbuster</application> is licensed under the 
  GNU General Public License (GPL). It is free to use, copy, 
  modify or distribute as you wish.
 </para>
 <para>
  There is no warranty of any kind, expressed, implied or otherwise. That is something
  that would cost real money ;-) There is no registration either. 
  <application>Junkbuster</application> really is <emphasis>free</emphasis>
  in every respect!

 </para>

<sect2 id="installation"><title>Installation</title>
<sect3 id="newinstall"><title>Can I install the new 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> over the old one?</title>
 <para>
   We recommend you uninstall the old <application>Junkbuster</application>
   first to minimize conflicts and confusion. You may want to 
   save your old configuration files for future reference. The configuration
   is substantially changed.
 </para>
 <para>
  See the user-manual for platform specific installation instructions.
  [FIXME: This is meant for after the name change!]
 </para>
 
</sect3>

<sect3 id="localhost"><title>What is the proxy address of Junkbuster?</title>
 <para>
  If you set up the <application>Junkbuster</application> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <quote>localhost</quote>
  (which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you have told the Internet
  Junkbuster to run on a different port with the
  <emphasis>listen-address</emphasis> config option). 
 </para>
 <para>
  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <quote>localhost</quote> in the boxes next to <quote>HTTP</quote>
  and <quote>Secure</quote> (HTTPS) and then the number <quote>8118</quote>
  for <quote>port</quote>.  
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Junkbuster</application> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <application>Junkbuster</application> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment would be 
  same as above.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Junkbuster</application> does not currently handle
  protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, or other Internet
  protocols. 
 </para>

<sect3 id="browseconfig"> <title>Why can I change the configuration with a
browser? Does that not raise security issues?</title>
 <para>
What I don't understand, is how I can browser edit the config file as a
regular user, while the whole /etc/junkbuster hierarchy belongs to the user
"junkbuster", with only 644 perms.
 </para>
 <para>
When you use the browser-based editor, JunkBuster itself is writing to the
config files.  Because JunkBuster is running as the user "junkbuster", it can
update the config files.
 </para>
 <para>
If you don't like this, setting "enable-edit-actions 0" in the config file
will disable the browser-based editor.  If you're that paranoid, you should
also consider setting "enable-remote-toggle 0" to prevent browser-based
enabling/disabling of JunkBuster.
 </para>
 <para>
Note that normally only local users can connect to JunkBuster, so this is not
(normally) a security problem.
 </para>
</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="misc"><title>Misc</title>

<sect3 id="loadingtimes"><title>I noticed considerable
delays in page requests compared to the old IJB. What's wrong?</title>
<para>
Using the default filtering configuration, I noticed considerable delays in
page requests compared to the old IJB. Loading pages with large contents
seemed to take forever, then suddenly delivering all the content at once.
 </para>
<para>
The whole content must be loaded in order to filter, and nothing is is
sent to the browser during this time. The loading time does not really
change in real numbers, but the feeling is different, because most
browsers are able to start rendering incomplete content, giving the
user a feeling of "it works". 
 </para>
<para>
To modify the content of a page (i.e. make frames resizeable again, etc.) and
not just replace ads, the Internet Junkbuster needs to download the entire
page first, do its content magic and then send the page to the browser.
</para>
</sect3>


<sect3 id="configurl"><title>What is the "http://i.j.b/"?</title>
<para>
Since JunkBuster sits between your web browser and the Internet, it can be
programmed to handle certain pages specially.
</para>

<para>
With recent versions of JunkBuster (version 2.9.x), you can get some
information about JunkBuster and change some settings by going to
http://i.j.b/ or, equivalently, http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
(Note that i.j.b is far easier to type but may not work in some
configurations).
</para>

<para>
These pages are *not* forwarded to a server on the internet - instead they are
handled by a special web server which is built in to JunkBuster.
</para>

<para>
If you are not running JunkBuster, then http://i.j.b/ will fail, and
http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/ will return a web page telling you
you're not running JunkBuster.
</para>

<para>
If you have version 2.0.2, then the equivalent is
http://example.com/show-proxy-args (but you get far less information, and you
should really consider upgrading to 2.9.x).
</para>
</sect3>


<sect3 id="badfiledesc"><title>I get the message 'Bad File Descriptor', why?</title>
<para>
   Fillme.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="proxy-chaining"><title>How do I chain Junkbuster with other proxies
(e.g. squid)?</title>
<para>
   Fillme.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="jointeam"><title>I would like to help you, what do I do?</title>
<para>
   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new developers,
   RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account on sourceforge.net
   and mail your id to the developer mailing list. Once we have added you to
   the team, you'll have write access to the CVS repository, and together
   we'll find a suitable task for you.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="blocklist"><title>Do you still maintain the blocklists?</title>
<para>
    No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the versions
    2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will again be
    blocklists that you can update automatically.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="newads"><title>How can I submit new ads?</title>
<para>
    As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
    have released the new version, there will again be a form on the website,
    which you can use to contribute new ads.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="ip"><title>How can I hide my IP address?</title>
<para>
 You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster or any other software, since
the server needs to know your IP address to send the answer to you.
</para>
<para>
Fortunately there are many publicly usable anonymous proxies out there, which
solve the problem by providing a further level of indirection between you and
the web server, shared by many people and thus letting your requests "drown"
in white noise of unrelated requests as far as user tracking is concerned.
</para>
<para>
Most of them will, however, log your IP address and make it available to the
authorities in case you abuse that anonymity for criminal purposes. In fact
you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.
</para>
<para>
You can find a list of anonymous public proxies at <ulink
url="http://www.multiproxy.org/anon_list.htm">multiproxy.org</ulink> and many
more through Google.
</para>
</sect3>

<!--  <sect3 id="image"><title>What is the imagefile (simage.ini, etc.) for?</title> -->
<!--  <para> -->
<!--   Anytime the Junkbuster determines (with the help of the blocklist) that a URL -->
<!--   contains an advertisement, it has to decide whether this advertisement is an -->
<!--   image or not. The Junkbuster uses the imagefile for that purpose. -->
<!--  </para> -->
<!--  </sect3> -->

<sect3>
<title id="anonforsure">Can Junkbuster guarantee I am anonymous?</title>
<para>
 No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but unless you
 are an expert on Internet security it would be safest to assume that
 everything you do on the Web can be traced back to you.
</para>
<para>
 <application>Junkbuster</application> can remove various information about you,
 and allows <emphasis>you</emphasis> more freedom  to decide which sites 
 you can trust. But it's still possible that web sites can find out who you
 are. Here's one way this can happen.
</para>
<para>
 A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <application>Junkbuster</application>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <application>NSClean</application>.
</para>
<para>
 Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,
 Luke!
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title id="sitebreak">Might some things break because header information is
changed?</title>

<para>
 Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what to
 display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be handled, 
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>USER AGENT</quote> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now is not
 recommended, since so many sites do look for this. You may get undesirable 
 results by changing this.
</para>

<para>
 For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <quote>User Agent</quote> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. Some page access counters work by looking at the
 <quote>REFERER</quote> header; they may fail or break if deprived. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <quote>REFERER</quote> or cookie is provided, is another example. There 
 are many, many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a 
 web server.
</para>

<para>
 If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your configuration 
 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.

</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title id="caching">Can Junkbuster act as a <quote>caching</quote> proxy?</title>
<para>
 No, it does not have this ability at all. You want something like 
 <ulink url="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</ulink> for this. And, yes, 
 before you ask, <application>Junkbuster</application> can co-exist 
 with other kinds of proxies like <quote>Squid</quote>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect2>
<title id="trouble">Troubleshooting</title>

<sect3>
<title id="refused">I just upgraded and am getting <quote>connection refused</quote>
with every web page?</title>
<para>
 Either <application>Junkbuster</application> is not running, or your 
 browser is configured for a different port than what
 <application>Junkbuster</application> is using.

</para>

<para>
 The old <application>Junkbuster</application> used port 8000 by 
 default. This has been changed to port 8118 now, due to a conflict 
 with NAS (Network Audio Service), which uses port 8000. If you haven't, 
 you need to change your browser to the new port number, or alternately 
 change <application>Junkbuster's</application> <quote>listen-address</quote>
 setting in the default <filename>config</filename> file.

</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title id="flushit">I just added a new rule, but the steenkin ad is 
still getting through. How?</title>
<para>
 If the ad had been displayed before you added its URL, it
 will probably be held in cache for some time, so it will be displayed without
 the need for any request to the server. The best thing to do is try 
 flusing the browser's caches.
</para>

<para>
 If this doesn't help, you probably don't have the configuration applied 
 incorrectly. Try pasting the full URL of the offending ad into
 <ulink url="http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info">http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/show-url-info</ulink>
 and see if any actions match.
