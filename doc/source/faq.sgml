<sect3 id="jointeam"><title>I would like to help you, what do I do?</title>
<para>
   Well, helping the team is always a good idea. We welcome new developers,
   RPM gurus or documentation makers. Simply get an account on sourceforge.net
   and mail your id to the developer mailing list. Once we have added you to
   the team, you'll have write access to the CVS repository, and we'll find a
   suitable task for you together.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="blocklist"><title>Do you still maintain the blocklists?</title>
<para>
    No. The format of the blocklists has changed significantly in the versions
    2.9.x. Once we have released the new version, there will again be
    blocklists that you can update automatically.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="newads"><title>How can I submit new ads?</title>
<para>
    As of now, please discontinue to submit new ad blocking infos. Once we
    have released the new version, there will again be a form on the website,
    which you can use to contribute new ads.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="ip"><title>How can I hide my IP address?</title>
<para>
 You cannot hide your IP address with Junkbuster.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="image"><title>What is the imagefile (simage.ini, etc.) for?</title>
<para>
 Anytime the Junkbuster determines (with the help of the blocklist) that a URL
 contains an advertisement, it has to decide whether this advertisement is an
 image or not. The Junkbuster uses the imagefile for that purpose.
</para>
