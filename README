This README is included with the development version of Junkbuster,
which will eventually become Junkbuster v3.0 (and soon we hope!). See
http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net.

Internet Junkbuster is a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for protecting privacy, filtering web page content,
managing cookies, controlling access, and removing ads, banners,
pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet Junk. Junkbuster has a very
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs
and tastes. Internet Junkbuster has application for both stand-alone
systems and multi-user networks.

JunkBuster was originally written by JunkBusters Corporation, and was
released as free open-source software under the GNU GPL. Stefan
Waldherr made many improvements, and started the SourceForge project
to continue development.

 INSTALL
--------

For tarball, first unpack:

 tar xzvf ijb-2.9.11-beta-src.tar.gz
 cd ijb-2.9.11-beta

 autoheader   [suggested for CVS source]
 autoconf     [suggested for CVS source]
 ./configure	(--help to see options)
 gmake        	(the make from gnu) 
 su 
 make -n install	(to see where all the files will go)
 make install		(to really install)

Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 'make
redhat-dist' or 'make suse-dist' (run ./configure first) from unpacked
sources. BSD will (probably?) require gmake (from http://gnu.org). See the
user-manual for OS/2 build instructions.

Junkbuster is also available via anonymous CVS:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current

This will create a directory named 'current'. Then, 'cd current', and then
build as above.


 RUN
----

 junkbuster /etc/junkbuster/config 

Or for RedHat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/junkbuster start
Or for SuSE:   /etc/rc.d/junkbuster start

The only command line option supported is the location of the 
main configuration file. If none is specified, Junkbuster will 
look for a file named 'config' for unix, config.txt for Win32 
in the current directory.


 CONFIGURATION
--------------

See: 'config', 'ijb.action', and 're_filterfile'. These are all well
commented. On Unix-like systems, these files are installed in /etc/junkbuster.
On Windows, then wherever the executable itself is installed. There are many
significant changes and advances since v2.0.x. The user-manual has a 
run down of configuration options, and examples: 
http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/user-manual/.

Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at <IP>:<Port>,
or whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'.
DEFAULT is localhost:8118.

The ijb.action file can be configured via the web interface accessed via
http://i.j.b/, as well other options.


 DOCUMENTATION
--------------

There is a growing amount of documentation in the 'doc'
subdirectory, but it is not finished at this point. In particular, see 
the user-manual there, and developers should look at 
developer-manual.

The best source of information on the current development version, may 
still be either comments in the source code, or the included configuration
files, which are all well commented. These are 'config', 'ijb.action', and
're_filterfile' in the toplevel source directory.

Some legacy documentation is also included only to give an idea of
what Junkbuster can do under doc/obsolete/*. Much has changed since
these docs were written, so beware.


 BUGS
-----

Use the form at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?group_id=11118&atid=111118 to
report bugs. Please read the exising bug reports before submitting
anything new. We ask that these not be reported on the mailing lists, 
since this is harder to track, and to make sure all reports are 
addressed.
