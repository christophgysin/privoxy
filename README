This README is included with the development version of Junkbuster,
which will eventually become Junkbuster v3.0. See
http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net.

Internet Junkbuster is a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for protecting privacy and removing ads, banners, pop-ups
and other obnoxious Internet Junk.


 INSTALL
--------

For tarball, first unpack:

 tar zxvf ijb_source_*
 cd ijb_source_2.9.9_alpha

 ./configure
 make
 su
 make install

Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 'make
redhat-dist' or 'make suse-dist' (run ./configure first). BSD
will (probably) require gmake (from http://gnu.org). See the 
user-manual for OS/2 build instructions.

Junkbuster is also availabe via anonymous CVS:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current

This will create a directory named 'current'. Then, 'cd current', and then
build as above.


 RUN
----

 junkbuster /etc/junkbuster/config &

Or for RPMS: /etc/rc.d/init.d/junkbuster start

The only command line option supported is the location of the 
main configuration file. If none is specified, Junkbuster will 
look for a file named 'config' in the current directory.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

See: 'config', 'actionsfile', and 're_filterfile'. These are all well
commented. There are many changes and advances since v2.0.x. Be sure to set
your browsers for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at localhost:8000.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The best source of information on the current development version, is
either comments in the source code, or the included configuration
files, which are all well commented. These are 'config',
'actionsfile', and 're_filterfile' in the toplevel source directory.

There is a growing amount of new documentation in the 'doc'
subdirectory, but it is sparse at this point. In particular, see 
the user-manual there.

Some legacy documentation is also included only to give an idea of
what Junkbuster can do under doc/obsolete/*. Much has changed since
these docs were written, so beware.


BUGS
----

Use the form at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?group_id=11118&atid=111118 to
report bugs. Please read the exising bug reports before submitting
anything new.
