This README is included with the development version of Privoxy,
which will eventually become Privoxy v3.0 (and soon we hope!). See
http://www.privoxy.org/.

Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies,
controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a very flexible configuration and
can be customized to suit individual needs and tastes. Internet
Privoxy has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is based on the code of the Internet Junkbuster. Junkbuster
was originally written by JunkBusters Corporation, and was released as
free open-source software under the GNU GPL. Stefan Waldherr made many
improvements, and started the SourceForge project to continue
development. Several other developers are now contributing.


 IMPORTANT CHANGES
------------------

NEWS! As of 03/24/02, the name of this project has been changed 
from Junkbuster to Privoxy. This is reflected in many of the 
included files. 

WARNING! If upgrading from earlier versions of this project via 
RPM packages, the new package will delete any previously installed 
'Junkbuster' packages.

IMPORTANT! READ! Configuration Change as of 3 Apr 2002: The default
listening port is now 8118 due to conflicts with port 8000 assignment.
You will need to change your browser if upgrading!!! And maybe
firewall, etc.


 INSTALL
--------

For tarball, first unpack:

 tar xzvf privoxy-2.9.13-beta-src.tar.gz
 cd privoxy-2.9.13-beta

 autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure	(--help to see options)
 gmake        	(the make from gnu) 
 su 
 make -n install	(to see where all the files will go)
 make install		(to really install)

Redhat and SuSE src and binary RPMs can be built with 'make
redhat-dist' or 'make suse-dist' (run ./configure first) from unpacked
sources. BSD will (probably?) require gmake (from http://gnu.org). See
the user-manual for OS/2 build instructions.

Privoxy is also available via anonymous CVS:

 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login
 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current

This will create a directory named 'current'. Then, 'cd current', and
then build as above.


 RUN
----

privoxy [--help] [--version] [--no-daemon] [--pidfile PIDFILE] 
 [--user USER] [config_file]

Or for RedHat: /etc/rc.d/init.d/privoxy start
Or for SuSE:   /etc/rc.d/privoxy start

See the man page or user-manual for a brief explanation of each.


 CONFIGURATION
--------------

See: 'config', '*.action', and 'default.filter'. These are all well
commented. Most of the magic is in '*.action', and there are several 
of these included with varying degrees of aggressiveness. On Unix-like
systems, these files are installed in /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever
the executable itself is installed. There are many significant changes and
advances since Junkbuster v2.0.x. The user-manual has a run down of
configuration options, and examples: http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.

Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at <IP>:<Port>, or
whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'.
DEFAULT is localhost:8118.

The default.action file can be configured via the web interface accessed
via http://p.p/, as well other options.


 DOCUMENTATION
--------------

There is a growing amount of documentation in the 'doc' subdirectory,
but it is not finished at this point. In particular, see the
user-manual there, and developers should look at developer-manual.

The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
may still be either comments in the source code, or the included configuration
files, which are all well commented. These are 'config', '*.action', and
'default.filter' in the toplevel source directory.

Some legacy Junkbuster documentation may also be included only to give an idea
of what Privoxy can do under doc/obsolete/*. Much has changed since these docs
were written, so beware.

Included documentation may vary according to platform and packager.


 CONTACTING THE DEVELOPERS, BUG REPORTING AND FEATURE REQUESTS
--------------------------------------------------------------

We value your feedback. However, to provide you with the best support,
please note:
   
 * Use the support forum to get help:
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&atid=211118
 * Submit bugs only thru our bug forum:
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11118&atid=111118 
   Make sure that the bug has not already been submitted. Please try
   to verify that it is a Privoxy bug, and not a browser or site
   bug first. If you are using your own custom configuration, please
   try the stock configs to see if the problem is a configuration
   related bug. And if not using the latest development snapshot,
   please try the latest one. Or even better, CVS sources.
 * Submit feature requests only thru our feature request forum:
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=361118&group_id=11118&func=browse
     
For any other issues, feel free to use the mailing lists:
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=11118
   
Anyone interested in actively participating in development and related
discussions can join the appropriate mailing list here:
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=11118. Archives are available
here too.
