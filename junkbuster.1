.SH NAME
\fBjunkbuster\fP
- The
Internet Junkbuster
Proxy
\s-2(TM)\s+2
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjunkbuster\fP
\fI\&[config_file] &\fP
.br
\fBjunkbstr.exe\fP
\fI\&[config_file]\fP
(Windows)
.br
.P
If the configuration file is not specified on the command line,
\fBJunkbuster\fP will look for a file named \fIconfig\fP in the 
current directory (except on Amiga where it will look for 
\fIAmiTCP:db/junkbuster/config\fP and Win32 where it will try 
\fIjunkbstr.txt\fP).


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBJunkbuster\fP
is an instrumentable HTTP proxy that filters the 
\s-2HTTP\s0
data stream between
web servers and browsers.
\fBJunkbuster\fP can be used to protect privacy, manage cookies, filter web
page content, manage access restrictions, and to discard such annoying Internet
junk as ads, banners, and pop-ups. Or whatever other annoyances strike your
fancy.

.SH INSTALLATION AND USE
Browsers must be configured to use 
\fBJunkbuster\fP
(the default is localhost, 
port 8000).
To set the 
\s-2HTTP\s0
proxy in Netscape and Mozilla,
go through:
\fB\&Edit\fP;
\fB\&Preferences\fP;
\fB\&Advanced\fP;
\fB\&Proxies\fP;
\fB\&Manual Proxy Configuration\fP;
\fB\&View\fP.
.P
For Internet Explorer,
go through:
\fB\&Tools\fP;
\fB\&Internet Properties\fP;
\fB\&Connections\fP;
\fB\&LAN Settings\fP.
.P
Set the HTTP proxy location for localhost, port 8000.
The
Secure (SSL) Proxy\" ijbfaq.html#security
should also be set to the same values,
otherwise
\fB\&https:\fP
\s-2URL\s0s
won't be proxied.

.SH CONFIGURATION
All \fBJunkbuster\fP configuration is done via the various configuarion 
files. The default configuration files are: \fIconfig\fP, 
\fIactionsfile\fP, and \fIre_filterfile\fP. These are well commented. 
On Unix and Unix-like systems, these are located in \fI/etc/junkbuster/\fP 
by default. On Windows and OS/2, these files are in the same directory 
as the \fBJunkbuster\fP executable. 
.P
The name and number of configuration files has changed from previous versions,
and is subject to change as development progresses. In fact, the configuration
itself is changed and much more sophisticated. See the user-manual for a brief
explanation of all configuration options.
