# Sample permissions file for the Internet Junkbuster 2.9.4
#
# For information, see http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with a # are ignored.
#
# Each line has the following format:
# [flags][domain][:port][/path]
#
# There should be no spaces between the components.
#
# The domain, port, and path parts make up the pattern used
# to match URLs.  The port part must be a number and must
# match exactly.  The domain part is matched by comparing
# each sub-domain (between the dots) from right to left.
# e.g.:
#  - The pattern "com" matches "anything.com"
#  - The pattern "yahoo.com" would match "mail.yahoo.com",
#    "login.yahoo.com", "www.yahoo.com", or "yahoo.com".
# "*" characters are allowed immediately before a dot or at
# the end of the domain, and match anything.  e.g.:
#  - "microsoft.*" matches "microsoft.com" and "microsoft.net",
#    (and "www.microsoft.com", "office.microsoft.com", etc)
#    but not "microsoft.xyz.com" or "microsoft.co.uk".
# - "ad*.*.*.*" matches "ad.doubleclick.co.uk"
# - "*.*click.*.*" is invalid ("*" is not followed by ".")
#
# The path part is a prefix match (if JunkBuster was compiled
# without REGEX), or a POSIX regular expression (if JunkBuster
# was compiled with REXEX but not PCRE), or a PERL (PCRE)
# regular expression (if JunkBuster was compiled with the
# default options).  "^" is automatically prepended to the RE
# before the "/".
#
# Flags are:
#
# (no flags) Allow cookies and popups, don't re_filter.  (compatibility mode)
#       >    Do not allow cookies to be set by the website.
#       <    Do not allow cookies to be read by the website.
#       <>   Block all cookies.
#       %    Enable re_filterfile processing for this site
#       ^    Block popups from this site.
#       ~    Same as all of <>%^
#
# Multiple flags may be specified.
#
# If a web page's URL matches the specified pattern, then the
# flags specified for that site are used.  If it matches more
# than one pattern, then the first match (searching top-to-bottom
# in this file) is used.
# 
# If a URL does not match any of the patterns in this file,
# then the default settings are used.  The default can be set
# by a line in this file which contains flags but no pattern.
# If this is not specified, then the default is ~
#

# EXAMPLES:
#
# To permit an entire site to set cookies, simply include its domain name:
# really-trustyworthy-people.org
#
# You can allow cookies out, but stop them coming in:
# >%^send-user-cookies.com
#
# dabs.com requires cookies and popups:
# %dabs.com
#
# Windows Update is fragile, so allow everything:
# windowsupdate.microsoft.com
