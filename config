#
#  1. INTRODUCTION
#
#  This file holds the Junkbuster configuration.  If you modify this
#  file, you will need to stop & restart Junkbuster, or use the
#  "Reload Config" option (Windows) before any changes take effect.
#
#  When starting Junkbuster on Unix systems, give the name of this
#  file as an argument.  On Windows systems, Junkbuster will look for
#  this file with the name 'junkbustr.txt' in the same directory where
#  Junkbuster is installed.
#
#  2. FORMAT OF THE CONFIGURATION FILE
#
#  Configuration lines consist of an initial keyword followed by a list
#  of values, all separated by whitespace (any number of spaces or
#  tabs).  For example,
#
#  blockfile blocklist.ini
#
#  Indicates that the blockfile is named 'blocklist.ini'.
#
#  The '#' indicates a comment.  Any part of a line following a '#' is
#  ignored, except if the '#' is preceded by a '\'.
#
#  Thus, by placing a # at the start of an existing configuration line,
#  you can make it a comment and it will be treated as if it weren't there. 
#  This is called "commenting out" an option and can be useful to turn
#  off features: If you comment out the "logfile" line, junkbuster will
#  not log at all. Watch for the "default:" section in each explanation
#  to see what happens if the option is left unset (or commented out). 
#
#  Long lines can be continued on the next line by using a `\' as
#  the last character. This also works if comments are present in
#  between.
#  

#
#  3. OTHER CONFIGURATION FILES
#
#  Junkbuster uses a number of other files to tell it what ads to
#  block, what cookies to accept, etc.  This section of the
#  configuration file tells Junkbuster where to find all those other
#  files.
#
#  On Windows, Junkbuster looks for these files in the same
#  directory as the executable.  On Unix, Junkbuster looks for these
#  files in the current working directory.  In either case, an
#  absolute path name can be used to avoid problems.

# While we go modular and multiuser, the blocker, filter, and 
# per-user config will be stored in subdirectories of confdir.
# Now, only confdir/templates is used for storing HTML templates
# for CGI results.
#
confdir .

#  The permissions file contains patterns to specify the
#  filtering rules to apply to each site.
#
#  Default: Cookies to and from all destinations are filtered.
#           Popups are disabled for all sites.
#           All sites are filtered if re_filterfile specified.
#           No sites are blocked.  Nothing is an image.
#
permissionsfile ./permissionsfile

#
#  The re_filterfile contains content modification rules.  These rules
#  permit powerful changes on the content of Web pages, e.g., you
#  could disable your favourite JavaScript annoyances, rewrite the
#  actual content, or just have some fun replacing "Microsoft"
#  with "Microsuck" wherever it appears on a Web page.
#
#  Default: No content modification.
#
re_filterfile   ./re_filterfile

#
#  The logfile is where all logging and error messages are written.
#  The logfile can be useful for tracking down a problem with
#  Junkbuster (e.g., it's not blocking an ad you think it should
#  block) but in most cases you probably will never look at it.
#
#  Your logfile will grow indefinitely, and you will probably want to
#  periodically remove it.  On Unix systems, you can do this with a
#  cron job (see 'man cron').
#
#  On SuSE Linux systems, you can place a line like
#  "/var/log/junkbuster.* +1024k 644 nobody.nogroup" in /etc/logfiles,
#  with the effect that cron.daily will automatically archive, gzip,
#  and empty the log, when it exceeds 1M size.
#
#  Default: Log to the standard error channel, not to a file
#
logfile      ./junkbuster.log

#
#  The jarfile defines where Junkbuster stores the cookies it
#  intercepts.  Note that if you use a jarfile, it may grow quite
#  large. 
#
#  Default: Don't store intercepted cookies
#
#jarfile     ./jarfile

#
#  The forwardfile defines domain-specific forwarding of HTTP
#  requests.  In some cases, you may want Junkbuster to forward your
#  request to another proxy instead of trying to fetch the request
#  itself.  In those cases, you can use the forwardfile to indicate
#  which requests should be forwarded and to where.
#
#  Default: Make all connections directly.
#
forwardfile   ./forward

#
#  Generally, Junkbuster is used as a personal proxy.  The default
#  behaviour of Junkbuster is to listen on port 8000 on the "loopback"
#  interface, so that it will only listen to local requests from the
#  same machine.  Using 'listen-address' (see below) you can serve
#  requests from other machines as well.
#
#  In that case, it is a wise thing to define access control lists
#  (acls), which state who can connect to your proxy and what service
#  they will be given. Note that setting the listen-address to an IP
#  address that is only internally reachable from your local network
#  might already do the trick.
#
#  Default: No access control. Everybody that can reach junkbuster
#           will be served.
#
#aclfile   ./aclfile

#
#  4. OPTIONS
#
#  This part of the configuration file contains options that control
#  how Junkbuster operates.
#

#
#  Listen-address specifies the address and port where Junkbuster will
#  listen for connections from your Web browser.  The default is to
#  listen on the local host on port 8000, and this is suitable for
#  most users.  (In your web browser, under proxy configuration, list
#  the proxy server as 'localhost' and the port as '8000').
# 
#  If you already have another service running on port 8000, or if you
#  want to serve requests from other machines (e.g. on your local
#  network) as well, you will need to override the default. The syntax
#  is "listen-address [<ip-address>]:<port>" If you leave out the ip
#  adress, junkbuster will bind to all interfaces (addresses) on your
#  machine and may become reachable from the internet. In that case,
#  consider using access control lists (acl's) (see "aclfile" above).
#
#  For example, suppose you are running Junkbuster on a machine which
#  has the address 192.168.0.1 on your local private network
#  (192.168.0.0) and has another outside connection with a different
#  address. You want it to serve requests from inside only:
#
#     listen-address 192.168.0.1:8000
#
#  If you want it to listen on all addresses (including the outside
#  connection):
#
#     listen-address :8000
#
#  If you do this, consider using acls (see "aclfile" above).
#
#  Note: you will need to point your browser(s) to the address
#  and port that you have configured here.
#
#  Default:  listen-address    localhost:8000 
#            listen-address    127.0.0.1:8000
#


#
#  The debug option sets the level of debugging information to log in
#  the logfile (and to the console in the Windows version).  A debug
#  level of 1 is informative because it will show you each request as
#  it happens.  Higher levels of debug are probably only of interest
#  to developers.
#
#   debug         1 # GPC  = show each GET/POST/CONNECT request
#   debug         2 # CONN = show each connection status
#   debug         4 # IO   = show I/O status
#   debug         8 # HDR  = show header parsing
#   debug        16 # LOG  = log all data into the logfile
#   debug        32 # FRC  = debug force feature
#   debug        64 # REF  = debug regular expression filter 
#   debug       128 # RED  = debug fast redirects
#   debug       256 # CLF  = Common Log Format
#   debug      4096 # INFO = Startup banner and warnings.
#   debug      8192 # ERROR = Non-fatal errors
#
#  It is *highly recommended* that you enable ERROR
#  reporting.  (debug 8192).
#
#  The reporting of FATAL errors (i.e. ones which crash 
#  JunkBuster) is always on and cannot be disabled.
#
#  If you want to use CLF, you should set "debug 256" ONLY,
#  do not enable anything else.
#
#  Multiple "debug" directives, are OK - they're logical-OR'd
#  together. 
#
#   debug         15 # same as setting the first 4 listed above
#
#  Default: 0, i.e. log nothing but fatal errors
#
debug   1    # URLs
debug   4096 # Info
debug   8192 # Errors - *we highly recommended enabling this*

#
#  Junkbuster normally uses "multi-threading", a software technique
#  that permits it to handle many different requests simultaneously.
#  In some cases you may wish to disable this -- particularly if
#  you're trying to debug a problem.  The 'single-threaded' option
#  forces Junkbuster to handle requests sequentially.
#
#  Default: Multithreaded mode
#
#single-threaded

#
#    'toggle' allows you to temporarily disable all Junkbuster's 
#    filtering.  Just set "toggle 0".
#    
#    The Windows version of Junkbuster puts an icon in the system
#    tray, which allows you to change this option without having
#    to edit this file.  If you right-click on that icon (or select
#    the 'Options' menu), one choice is "Enable".  Clicking on enable
#    toggles Junkbuster on and off.  This is useful if you want to
#    temporarily disable Junkbuster, e.g., to access a site that
#    requires cookies which you normally have blocked.
#
#    'toggle 1' means Junkbuster runs normally, 'toggle 0' means
#    that Junkbuster becomes a non-anonymizing non-blocking
#    proxy.
#
#  Default: 1
#
toggle 1

#
#  5. WINDOWS GUI OPTIONS
#
#  Junkbuster has a number of options specific to the Windows GUI
#  interface:
#
#    activity-animation      {1 or 0}
#
#    If set to 1, the Junkbuster icon will animate when Junkbuster is
#    active.
#
#Win32-only: activity-animation      1

#    log-messages            {1 or 0}
#
#    If set to 1, Junkbuster will log messages to the console window.
#
#Win32-only: log-messages            1

#    log-buffer-size         {1 or 0}?
#
#    If log-buffer-size is set to 1, the size of the log buffer, that
#    is the amount of memory used for the log messages displayed in
#    the console window, will be limited to 'log-max-lines' (see below).
#
#    Warning: Setting this to 0 will result in the buffer to grow
#             infinitely and eat up all your memory!
#
#Win32-only: log-buffer-size   1

#    log-max-lines   {number of lines, e.g., '200'}
#
#    Maximum number of lines held in the log buffer. See above.
#
#Win32-only: log-max-lines   200

#    log-highlight-messages  {1 or 0}
#
#    If set to 1, Junkbuster will highlight portions of the log
#    messages with a bold-faced font.
#
#Win32-only: log-highlight-messages  1

#    log-font-name           {font name, e.g., 'Comic Sans MS'}
#
#    The font used in the console window.
#
#Win32-only: log-font-name           Comic Sans MS

#    log-font-size           {font size in points, e.g., '8'}
#
#    Font size used in the console window.
#
#Win32-only: log-font-size           8

#    show-on-task-bar        {1 or 0}
#
#    Controls whether or not Junkbuster will appear as a button on the Task
#    bar when minimized.
#
#Win32-only: show-on-task-bar        0


#    close-button-minimizes  1
#
#    If set, the Windows close button will minimize Junkbuster instead
#    of closing the program (close with the exit option on the File
#    menu).
#
#Win32-only: close-button-minimizes  1

#    hide-console
#
#    If this option is used, Junkbuster will disconnect from and hide 
#    the command console.
#
#Win32-only: #hide-console
