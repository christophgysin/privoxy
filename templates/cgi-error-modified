# No-Such-Domain Error Output template for junkbuster 2.9.x.
#
#
# USING HTML TEMPLATES:
# ---------------------
#
# Template files are written win plain HTML, with a few
# additions:
# 
# - Lines that start with a '#' character like this one
#   are ignored
#
# - Each item in the below list of exported symbols will
#   be replaced by dynamically generated text, if they
#   are enclosed in '@'-characters. E.g. The string @version@
#   will be replaced by the version number of Junkbuster.
#
# - One special application of this is to make whole blocks
#   of the HTML template disappear if the condition <name>
#   is not given. Simply enclose the block between the two
#   strings @if-<name>start and if-<name>-end@. The strings
#   should be placed in HTML comments (<!-- -->), so the
#   html structure won't be messed when the magic happens.
#   
# USABLE SYMBOLS IN THIS TEMPLATE:
# --------------------------------
#
#  my-ip-addr:

#
# CONDITIONAL SYMBOLS FOR THIS TEMPLATE AND THEIR DEPANDANT SYMBOLS:

          <p>Possible causes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you got here using your browser's "back" button, then
               that is deliberately disabled for this page.  Please

            <li>Perhaps you've got more than one browser window open, and
               you're trying to change the same file in both?  You can
               only have one editor window open at a time.  Your other edit
               window should continue to function.</li>
            <li>You may have modified the file some other way - perhaps by
