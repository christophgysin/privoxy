# "Blocked" Error Output template for junkbuster 2.9.x.
# Compact variant.
#
# USING HTML TEMPLATES:
# ---------------------
#
# Template files are written win plain HTML, with a few
# additions:
# 
# - Lines that start with a '#' character like this one
#   are ignored
#
# - Each item in the below list of exported symbols will
#   be replaced by dynamically generated text, if they
#   are enclosed in '@'-characters. E.g. The string @version@
#   will be replaced by the version number of Junkbuster.
#
# - One special application of this is to make whole blocks
#   of the HTML template disappear if the condition <name>
#   is not given. Simply enclose the block between the two
#   strings @if-<name>start and if-<name>-end@. The strings
#   should be placed in HTML comments (<!-- -->), so the
#   html structure won't be messed when the magic happens.
