.TH "PRIVOXY" "1" "18 April 2002" "Privoxy 2.9.14 beta" ""
.SH NAME
privoxy \- Privacy Enhancing Proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBprivoxy\fR [\fB--help\fR]  [\fB--version\fR]  [\fB--no-daemon\fR]  [\fB--pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR]  [\fB--user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR]  [\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR] \fB(UNIX)\fR


\fBprivoxy.exe\fR [\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR] \fB(Windows)\fR

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR may be invoked with the following command line
options:
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Print brief usage info and exit.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print version info and exit.
.TP
\fB--no-daemon\fR
Don't  become  a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process group
leader, don't detach from controlling tty, and do all logging there.
.TP
\fB--pidfile \fIpidfile\fB\fR
On startup, write the process ID to \fIpidfile\fR.
Delete the \fIpidfile\fR on exit.
Failiure to create or delete the \fIpidfile\fR
is non-fatal. If no \fB--pidfile\fR option is given, no PID file will be used.
.TP
\fB--user \fIuser[.group]\fB\fR
After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of
\fIuser\fR and the GID of
\fIgroup\fR, or, if the optional
\fIgroup\fR was not given, the default group of
\fIuser\fR. Exit if the privileges are not
sufficient to do so.
.PP
If the \fIconfigfile\fR is not specified on  the  command  line,
\fBPrivoxy\fR  will  look for a file named
\fIconfig\fR in the current directory (except on Win32 where
it will try \fIconfig.txt\fR). If no
\fIconfigfile\fR is found, \fBPrivoxy\fR will 
fail to start.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR is a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for protecting privacy, filtering web page content, managing
cookies, controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
obnoxious Internet junk. \fBPrivoxy\fR has a very
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. \fBPrivoxy\fR has application for both
stand-alone systems and multi-user networks.
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR is based on \fBInternet
Junkbuster\fR (tm).
.SH "INSTALLATION AND USAGE"
.PP
Browsers must be individually configured to use \fBPrivoxy\fR as
a HTTP proxy.  The default setting is  for  localhost,  on port  8118
(configurable in the main config file).  To set the HTTP proxy in Netscape
and Mozilla, go through:  \fBEdit\fR;
\fBPreferences\fR;  \fBAdvanced\fR;
\fBProxies\fR;  \fBManual Proxy Configuration\fR;
\fBView\fR. 
.PP
For Internet Explorer, go through: \fBTools\fR; 
\fBInternet Properties\fR; \fBConnections\fR;
\fBLAN Settings\fR. 
.PP
The Secure (SSL) Proxy should also be set to the same values, otherwise
https: URLs will not be proxied. 
.PP
For other browsers, check the documentation.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR can be configured with the various configuration
files. The default configuration files are: \fIconfig\fR,
\fIdefault.action\fR, and
\fIdefault.filter\fR. These are well commented.  On Unix and
Unix-like systems, these are located in \fI/etc/privoxy/\fR by
default. On Windows, OS/2 and AmigaOS, these files are in the same directory
as the \fBPrivoxy\fR executable.
.PP
The name and number of configuration files has changed from previous
versions, and is subject to change as development progresses. In fact, the
configuration itself is changed  and  much more sophisticated. See the
user-manual for a
brief explanation of all configuration options. 
.PP
The actions list (ad blocks, etc) can also be configured with your
web browser at http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config.
\fBPrivoxy's\fR configuration parameters  can also  be viewed at
the same page. In addition, \fBPrivoxy\fR can be toggled on/off.
This is an internal page.
.SH "SAMPLE CONFIGURATION"
.PP
A brief example of what a \fIdefault.action\fR configuration
might look like:

.nf

 # Define a few useful custom aliases for later use
 {{alias}}

 # Don't accept cookies
 +no-cookies = +no-cookies-set +no-cookies-read

 # Do accept cookies
 -no-cookies = -no-cookies-set -no-cookies-read

 # Treat these blocked URLs as images.
 +imageblock = +block +image

 # Define page filters we want to use.
 myfilters = +filter{html-annoyances} +filter{js-annoyances}\\
             +filter{no-popups} +filter{webbugs}

\fIuser-manual\fR
for explanations of the above syntax, and other \fBPrivoxy\fR
configuration options.

.PP
Various other files should be included, but may vary depending on platform
and build configuration. More documentation should be included in the local
documentation directory, though is not complete at this time.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
\fBPrivoxy\fR terminates on the \fBSIGINT\fR,
\fBSIGTERM\fR and \fBSIGABRT\fR signals. Log
rotation scripts may cause a re-opening of the logfile by sending a 
\fBSIGHUP\fR to \fBPrivoxy\fR. Note that unlike
other daemons,  \fBPrivoxy\fR does not need to be made aware of
config file changes by \fBSIGHUP\fR -- it will detect them
automatically. 
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
This is a beta version of \fBPrivoxy\fR. Not 
all features are well tested.
.PP
Please see the \fIuser-manual\fR on how to contact the
developers for feature requests, reporting problems, and other questions.
