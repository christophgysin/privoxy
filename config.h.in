 * Purpose     :  This file should be the first thing included in every
 *                .c file.  (Before even system headers).  It contains 
 *                #define statements for various features.  It was
 *                introduced because the compile command line started
 *                getting ludicrously long with feature defines.

 * Detect image requests automatically for MSIE.  Will fall back to

 *
 * It detects the following header pair as an image request:
 *
 * User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)
 * Accept: * / *
 *
 * And the following as a HTML request:
 *
 * User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)
 * Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, * / *
 *
 * And no, I haven't got that backwards - IE is being wierd.
 *
 * Known limitations: 
 * 1) If you press shift-reload on a blocked HTML page, you get
 *    the image "blocked" page, not the HTML "blocked" page.
 * 2) Once an image "blocked" page has been sent, viewing it 
 *    in it's own browser window *should* bring up the HTML
 *    "blocked" page, but it doesn't.  You need to clear the 
 *    browser cache to get the HTML version again.
 *
 * These limitations are due to IE making inconsistent choices
 * about which "Accept:" header to send.
