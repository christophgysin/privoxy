 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log$
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/07/29 17:28:11  jongfoster
 *    Rebuilt based on latest configure.in and acconfig.h
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/07/29 17:09:17  jongfoster
 *    Major changes to build system in order to fix these bugs:
 *    - pthreads under Linux was broken - changed -lpthread to -pthread
 *    - Compiling in MinGW32 mode under CygWin now correctly detects
 *      which shared libraries are available
 *    - Solaris support (?) (Not tested under Solaris yet)
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/07/25 22:53:59  jongfoster
 *    Will #error if pthreads is enabled under BeOs
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/07/15 17:54:29  jongfoster
 *    Renaming #define STATIC to STATIC_PCRE
 *    Adding new #define FEATURE_PTHREAD that will be used to enable
 *    POSIX threads support.
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/07/13 13:48:37  oes
 *     - (Fix:) Copied CODE_STATUS #define from config.h.in
 *     - split REGEX #define into REGEX_GNU and REGEX_PCRE
 *       and removed PCRE.
 *       (REGEX = REGEX_GNU || REGEX_PCRE per project.h)
 *     - Moved STATIC (for pcre) here from Makefile.in
 *     - Introduced STATIC_PCRS #define to allow for dynaimc linking with
 *       libpcrs
 *     - Removed PCRS #define, since pcrs is now needed for CGI anyway
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/permissionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/26 01:26:34  jongfoster
 *    New #define, WIN_GUI_EDIT, enables the (embryonic) Win32 GUI editor.
 *    This #define cannot be set from ./configure - there's no point, it
 *    doesn't work yet.  See feature request # 425722
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/22 17:43:35  oes
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering banners by size rather than URL
 *      by adding patterns that replace all standard banner
 *      sizes with the "Junkbuster" gif to the re_filterfile
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering WebBugs by providing a pattern
 *      which kills all 1x1 images
 *
 *    - Added support for PCRE_UNGREEDY behaviour to pcrs,
 *      which is selected by the (nonstandard and therefore
 *      capital) letter 'U' in the option string.
 *      It causes the quantifiers to be ungreedy by default.
 *      Appending a ? turns back to greedy (!).
 *
 *    - Added a new interceptor ijb-send-banner, which
 *      sends back the "Junkbuster" gif. Without imagelist or
 *      MSIE detection support, or if tinygif = 1, or the
 *      URL isn't recognized as an imageurl, a lame HTML
 *      explanation is sent instead.
 *
 *    - Added new feature, which permits blocking remote
 *      script redirects and firing back a local redirect
 *      to the browser.
 *      The feature is conditionally compiled, i.e. it
 *      can be disabled with --disable-fast-redirects,
 *      plus it must be activated by a "fast-redirects"
 *      line in the config file, has its own log level
 *      and of course wants to be displayed by show-proxy-args
 *      Note: Boy, all the #ifdefs in 1001 locations and
 *      all the fumbling with configure.in and acconfig.h
 *      were *way* more work than the feature itself :-(
 *
 *    - Because a generic redirect template was needed for
 *      this, tinygif = 3 now uses the same.
 *
 *    - Moved GIFs, and other static HTTP response templates
 *      to project.h
 *
 *    - Many minor fixes
 *
 *    - Removed some >400 CRs again (Jon, you really worked
 *      a lot! ;-)
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:58:45  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree

 * 2) Once an image "blocked" page has been sent, viewing it 
 *    in it's own browser window *should* bring up the HTML
 *    "blocked" page, but it doesn't.  You need to clear the 
 *    browser cache to get the HTML version again.
 *
 * These limitations are due to IE making inconsistent choices
 * about which "Accept:" header to send.
