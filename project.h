 *    changed struct interceptors to struct cgi_dispatcher,
 *    moved HTML stuff to cgi.h
 *
 *    Revision 1.13  2001/06/01 20:05:36  jongfoster
 *    Support for +image-blocker{}: added ACTION_IMAGE_BLOCKER
 *    constant, and removed csp->tinygif.
 *
 *    Revision 1.12  2001/06/01 18:49:17  jongfoster
 *    Replaced "list_share" with "list" - the tiny memory gain was not
 *    worth the extra complexity.
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2001/06/01 10:32:47  oes
 *    Added constants for anchoring selection bitmap
 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2001/05/31 21:33:53  jongfoster
 *    Changes for new actions file, replacing permissionsfile
 *    and parts of the config file.  Also added support for
 *    list_shared.
 *
 *    Revision 1.9  2001/05/31 17:32:31  oes
 *
 *     - Enhanced domain part globbing with infix and prefix asterisk
 *       matching and optional unanchored operation
 *
 *    Revision 1.8  2001/05/29 20:09:15  joergs
 *    HTTP_REDIRECT_TEMPLATE fixed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.7  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/actionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/05/27 22:17:04  oes
 *
 *    - re_process_buffer no longer writes the modified buffer
 *      to the client, which was very ugly. It now returns the
 *      buffer, which it is then written by chat.
 *
 *    - content_length now adjusts the Content-Length: header
 *      for modified documents rather than crunch()ing it.
 *      (Length info in csp->content_length, which is 0 for
 *      unmodified documents)
 *
 *    - For this to work, sed() is called twice when filtering.
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/22 18:46:04  oes
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering banners by size rather than URL
 *      by adding patterns that replace all standard banner
 *      sizes with the "Junkbuster" gif to the re_filterfile
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering WebBugs by providing a pattern
 *      which kills all 1x1 images
 *
 *    - Added support for PCRE_UNGREEDY behaviour to pcrs,
 *      which is selected by the (nonstandard and therefore
 *      capital) letter 'U' in the option string.
 *      It causes the quantifiers to be ungreedy by default.
 *      Appending a ? turns back to greedy (!).
 *
 *    - Added a new interceptor ijb-send-banner, which
 *      sends back the "Junkbuster" gif. Without imagelist or
 *      MSIE detection support, or if tinygif = 1, or the
 *      URL isn't recognized as an imageurl, a lame HTML
 *      explanation is sent instead.
 *
 *    - Added new feature, which permits blocking remote
 *      script redirects and firing back a local redirect
 *      to the browser.
 *      The feature is conditionally compiled, i.e. it
 *      can be disabled with --disable-fast-redirects,
 *      plus it must be activated by a "fast-redirects"
 *      line in the config file, has its own log level
 *      and of course wants to be displayed by show-proxy-args
 *      Note: Boy, all the #ifdefs in 1001 locations and
 *      all the fumbling with configure.in and acconfig.h
 *      were *way* more work than the feature itself :-(
 *
 *    - Because a generic redirect template was needed for
 *      this, tinygif = 3 now uses the same.
 *
 *    - Moved GIFs, and other static HTTP response templates
 *      to project.h
 *
 *    - Some minor fixes
 *
 *    - Removed some >400 CRs again (Jon, you really worked
 *      a lot! ;-)
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "actionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/17 23:01:01  oes
 *     - Cleaned CRLF's from the sources and related files
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:59:03  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree
