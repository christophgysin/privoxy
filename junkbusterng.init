#  Revisions   :
#     $Log$
#     Revision 1.1  2002/03/22 20:53:03  morcego
#     - Ongoing process to change name to JunkbusterNG
#     - configure/configure.in: no change needed
#     - GNUmakefile.in:
#             - TAR_ARCH = /tmp/JunkbusterNG-$(RPM_VERSION).tar.gz
#             - PROGRAM    = jbng@EXEEXT@
#             - rh-spec now references as junkbusterng-rh.spec
#             - redhat-upload: references changed to junkbusterng-* (package names)
#             - tarball-dist: references changed to JunkbusterNG-distribution-*
#             - tarball-src: now JunkbusterNG-*
#             - install: initscript now junkbusterng.init and junkbusterng (when
#                        installed)
#     - junkbuster-rh.spec: renamed to junkbusterng-rh.spec
#     - junkbusterng.spec:
#             - References to the expression ijb where changed where possible
#             - New package name: junkbusterng (all in lower case, acording to
#               the LSB recomendation)
#             - Version changed to: 2.9.13
#             - Release: 1
#             - Added: junkbuster to obsoletes and conflicts (Not sure this is
#               right. If it obsoletes, why conflict ? Have to check it later)
#             - Summary changed: Stefan, please check and aprove it
#             - Changes description to use the new name
#             - Sed string was NOT changed. Have to wait to the manpage to
#               change first
#             - Keeping the user junkbuster for now. It will require some aditional
#               changes on the script (scheduled for the next specfile release)
#             - Added post entry to move the old logfile to the new log directory
#             - Removing "chkconfig --add" entry (not good to have it automaticaly
#               added to the startup list).
#             - Added preun section to stop the service with the old name, as well
#               as remove it from the startup list
#             - Removed the chkconfig --del entry from the conditional block on
#               the preun scriptlet (now handled on the %files section)
#     - junkbuster.init: renamed to junkbusterng.init
#     - junkbusterng.init:
#             - Changed JB_BIN to jbng
#             - Created JB_OBIN with the old value of JB_BIN (junkbuster), to
#               be used where necessary (config dir)
#
#     Aditional notes:
#     - The config directory is /etc/junkbuster yet. Have to change it on the
#     specfile, after it is changes on the code
#     - The only files that got renamed on the cvs tree were the rh specfile and
#     the init file. Some file references got changes on the makefile and on the
#     rh-spec (as listed above)
