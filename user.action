# Say you've seen an ad on your favourite page on example.com that
# you want to get rid of. You have right-clicked the image, selected
# "copy image location" and pasted the URL below, into a { +block }
# section. Note that { +handle-as-image } need not be specified,
# since all URLs ending in .gif will be tagged as images by the
# general rules in default.action anyway:
# 
{ +block }

# Say the site where you do your homebanking needs to open
# popup windows, but you have chosen to kill popups by
# default. This will allow it for your-example-bank.com:
#
{ -filter{popups} -kill-popups }
