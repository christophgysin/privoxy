 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log$
 *    Revision 2.3  2002/12/30 19:56:16  david__schmidt
 *    End of initial drop of statistics console infrastructure.  Data stream
 *    is transmitted on the stats port every interval, provided the data has
 *    changed since the last transmission.  More work probably needs to be
 *    done with regard to multiplatform threading; I stole the thread spawning
 *    code from jcc.c, but haven't been able to test it everywhere.
 *
 *    Revision 2.2  2002/12/28 04:17:58  david__schmidt
 *    Fix null_routine on unix
 *
 *    Revision 2.1  2002/12/28 03:58:19  david__schmidt
 *    Initial drop of dashboard instrumentation - enabled with
 *    --enable-activity-console
