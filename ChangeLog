ChangeLog for Internet JunkBuster
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Version 2.2.11 Beta Changes (WIP) ***
- Various spec file and init script cleanups and improvements (Redhat and
SuSE).
- CGI Editor works on OS/2 now.
- Fix restart failure where sockets were in TIME_WAIT.
- Fixes for actions cgi editor, make sure we have right file.
- **READ**: The default listening PORT is NOW 8118!!! Changed from 
8000 due to conflict with NAS (Network Audio Server, whatever that 
is.)
- A --pidfile command line option now, in addition to --help, 
--version, --no-daemon, --user and configfile. --no-daemon replaces
the former -d option and _DEBUG define. --user will drop privileges 
to the specified user.
- Signal handling cleanups (*nix).
- CGI actions editor improvements and fixes.

(instead of 'blank').

of that browser session only (ie never goes to disk).
