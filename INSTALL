########## PRIVOXY INSTALL #############

For more info after the install, configure and use refer to the README in the
same dir as the INSTALL

To build Privoxy from source, autoconf, GNU make (gmake), and, of course, a C
compiler like gcc are required.

When building from a source tarball (either release version or nightly CVS
tarball), first unpack the source:

 tar xzvf privoxy-3.1.1-beta-src* [.tgz or .tar.gz]                            
 cd privoxy-3.1.1-beta                                                         

For retrieving the current CVS sources, you'll need CVS installed. Note that
sources from CVS are development quality, and may not be stable, or well
tested. To download CVS source:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa login          
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ijbswa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ijbswa co current 
  cd current                                                                         

This will create a directory named current/, which will contain the source
tree.

you can too check any privoxy branch, just change the "current" name with the
wanted branch name (Example: v_3_0_branch for the 3.0 cvs tree)

you should create the user and group that privoxy will run, the default is
"privoxy" for both

you can change the user and group with --with-user= and --with-group= in the
./configure step

the user and group should have the login disabled for better safety

here is my /etc/passwd entry 

privoxy:*:7777:7777:privoxy proxy:/no/home:/no/shell

and my /etc/group entry

privoxy:*:7777:privoxy

Then, in either case, to build from unpacked tarball or CVS source:

 autoheader                                                                    
 autoconf                                                                      
 ./configure      # (--help to see options, see the warning below)                                    
 make             # (the make from gnu, gmake for *BSD)                        
 su                                                                            
 make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)                       
 make install     # (to really install)                                        

If you have gnu make, you can have the first four steps automatically done for
you by just typing:

  make                 

in the freshly downloaded or unpacked source directory.

** WARNING **

1- if you are installing in /usr/local or / (root) the use of 

  --sysconfdir=$prefix/etc/privoxy

is recommended for a safer (there may already exist other program that uses a
file with the "config" name) and cleaner and easier to use etc dir

2- for user install dont forget to give the --with-user and --with-group equal
to the current user or tune things later

** END OF WARNING **
