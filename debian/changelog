privoxy (3.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop creating documentation, it's usually available upstream and can
    be used as is without depending on docbook and the like.
  * Added LICENSE, pdfs, privoxy-index and HTMLized man-page from package.
    The LICENSE is already mentioned in debian/copyright (adding a
    separate file conflicts with the policy), the man page is available in
    nroff format and the PDFs are not better than the HTML version.

privoxy (3.1.1-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debian-dist and debian-upload targets to the top level makefile.
    debian-dist runs "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc" so that
    any debian user can build it.
  * Removed build dependency on docbook, leaving generation of docs to
    another target or makefile.
