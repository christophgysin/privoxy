Description: Privacy enhancing HTTP Proxy
 Privoxy is an instrumentable HTTP proxy that filters the HTTP data
 stream between web servers and browsers.  Privoxy can be used to
 protect privacy, manage cookies, filter web page content, manage
 access restrictions, and to discard such annoying Internet junk as
 ads, banners, and pop-ups.  Or whatever other annoyances strike your
 fancy.
 .
 Privoxy is a derivate of junkbuster, but it uses a different name
 space and a different port (8118), so junkbuster and privoxy can
 coexist on one system.
