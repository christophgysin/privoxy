 *                #define statements for various features.  It was
 *                introduced because the compile command line started
 *                getting ludicrously long with feature defines.

 * Revisions   :
 *    $Log$
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/06/29 13:26:27  oes
 *    Introduced #define CODE_STATUS
 *
 *    Revision 1.1  2001/06/01 17:56:07  jongfoster
 *    Removing generated files config.h and pcre/chartables.c
 *    Now use a custom build step to copy config.h.win to config.h
 *    New VC++ project pcre/vc_dftables.dsp will generate pcre/chartables.c
 *    Also adding the new files list.[ch], actions.[ch] to the console build.
 *
 *    Revision 1.6  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/permissionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.5  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/25 22:17:28  jongfoster
 *    Resurrecting these files which are required for the MS Visual C++
 *    build only.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "permissionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:58:49  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree

 * You must also define IMAGE_BLOCKING to use this feature.

 * It detects the following header pair as an image request:

 * Accept: * / *
 *
 * And the following as a HTML request:

 *
 * Known limitations: 
 * 1) If you press shift-reload on a blocked HTML page, you get
 *    the image "blocked" page, not the HTML "blocked" page.
 * 2) Once an image "blocked" page has been sent, viewing it 
 *    in it's own browser window *should* bring up the HTML
 *    "blocked" page, but it doesn't.  You need to clear the 
 *    browser cache to get the HTML version again.
 *
 * These limitations are due to IE making inconsistent choices
 * about which "Accept:" header to send.
